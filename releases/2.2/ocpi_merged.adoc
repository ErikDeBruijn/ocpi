*Document revisions*
There can be multiple documentation revisions of the same version of the OCPI protocol.

The newer documentation revisions of the same protocol version can never change the content of the messages: no new fields or renaming of fields. A new revision can only clarify/fix texts/descriptions and fix typos etc.

These documentation revisions (not the first) will be named: d2, d3, d4 etc.

Examples:

- OCPI 2.1.1 is a different protocol version of OCPI than OCPI 2.1.

- OCPI 2.0-d2 is the same protocol version as OCPI 2.0, but a newer documentation revision: same protocol, newer documentation.

[[introduction_introduction_and_background]]
=== Introduction and background

The Open Charge Point Interface (OCPI) enables a scalable, automated EV roaming setup between Charge Point Operators and e-Mobility Service Providers.
It supports authorization, charge point information exchange (including live status updates and transaction events),
charge detail record exchange, remote charge point commands and the exchange of smart-charging related information between parties.

It offers market participants in EV an attractive and scalable solution for (international) roaming between networks,
avoiding the costs and innovation-limiting complexities involved with today's non-automated solutions or with central roaming hubs.
As such it helps to enable EV drivers to charge everywhere in a fully-informed way,
helps the market to develop quickly and helps market players to execute their business models in the best way.

What does it offer (main functionality):

* A good roaming system (for bilateral usage and/or via a hub).
* Real-time information about location, availability and price.
* A uniform way of exchanging data (Notification Data Records and Charge Data Records), before during and after the transaction.
* Remote mobile support to access any Charge Point without pre-registration.

Starting in 2009, e-laad foundation and the predecessor of the eViolin association specified 2 standards in order to retrieve
charge point details and active state. These are called the VAS interface and the Amsterdam interface. In this same period,
a CDR format for the exchange of charge sessions between eViolin members was defined.
This format is currently in use by the majority of the eViolin members.
(eViolin is the branch organization for EV operators and service providers in NL and responsible for national roaming and issuing of ID’s).
This resulted in 2014 in the development of OCPI.

An international group of companies already supports OCPI. Initiators are EV Box, The New Motion, ElaadNL, BeCharged,
GreenFlux and Last Mile Solutions. Other participants include Next Charge, Freshmile, Plugsurfing, Charge-partner, Hubject, e-clearing.net,
ihomer and Siemens. Several other major organizations and roaming platforms are interested in participating.
The Netherlands Knowledge Platform for Charging Infrastructure (NKL) facilitates and coordinates this project to guarantee progress
and ensure development and results. Part of this project is to find a place to continue development in the future.

This document describes a combined set of standards based on the work done in the past. Next to that,
the evolution of these standards and their use are taken into account and some elements have been updated to match nowadays use.

*OCPI is developed with support of:*

== Terminology and Definitions

=== Requirement Keywords
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt[https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt].

[[terminology_abbreviations]]
=== Abbreviations

[cols="2s,10",options="header"]
|===
|Abbr. |Description
|CDR   |Charge Detail Record
|CPO   |Charging Point Operator
|eMSP  |e-Mobility Service Provider
|EV    |Electric Vehicle
|EVSE  |Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment. Is considered as an independently operated and managed part of a Charge Point that can deliver energy to one EV at a time.
|JSON  |JavaScript Simple Object Notation
|NAP   |National Access Point
|NSP   |Navigation Service Provider
|OCPP  |Open Charge Point Protocol

|===


[[terminology_roles]]
=== EV Charging Market Roles

In the EV Charging landscape, different market roles can be identified.

[cols="3s,9",options="header"]
|===
|Role  |Description
|CPO   |Charging Point Operator: Operates a network of Charge Points.
|eMSP  |e-Mobility Service Provider: gives EV drivers access to charging services.
|Hub   |Can connect one or more CPOs to one or more eMSPs.
|NAP   |National Access Point: Provides a national Database with all (public) Charging Locations, information can be sent and retrieved from the NAP (that makes it different from a typical NSP).
|NSP   |Navigation Service Provider: Provides EV drivers with location information of Charge Points.
|Roaming Hub |See: Hub
|SCSP  |Smart Charging Service Provider: Provided Smart Charging service to other parties might use a lot of different inputs to calculate Smart Charging Profiles.
|===

Some of these roles can be combined in one company. A Platform can provide service for multiple CPOs or eMSPs,
but also for both eMSPs and CPOs.

OCPI 2.0/2.1.1 had a very strict definition of roles: only CPO and eMSP. But this is rare in the real world,
there are almost no parties that are strictly CPO or eMSP and have their own platform. In the real world, lots of
parties provide service to CPOs that are not running their own platform.
A lot of CPOs are also eMSP. With OCPI 2.1.1 and earlier that meant having to set up an OCPI connection per role.

OCPI 2.2 introduces more roles and abstracts the role from the OCPI connection itself.
OCPI 2.2 talks about Platforms connecting to Platforms, or Platforms connecting via Hubs to other Platforms.
The Platform itself is not a role. The Platform provides services for 1 or more roles.

Examples of platforms:

* A pure CPO: Not providing services to other CPOs. Not being an eMSP. Running its own software that connects via OCPI. +
  Is defined in OCPI as a Platform has 1 CPO role, the CPO role of that company.
* A Company that has a cloud-based eMSP software solution,
  it offers to companies that want to be eMSP, but don't want to host/run their own software. +
  Is a Platform that has a number of eMSP roles, one for each eMSP the company is providing services for.
  Not for this company itself because the company itself is not an eMSP.
* A Company that operates public Charge Points and also provides eMSP service to EV drivers, running their own software platform. +
  Is seen in OCPI as a Platform that has 2 roles: CPO and eMSP for this company.
* If one the companies above starts to offer their service to other CPOs and eMSP, it is in OCPI still seen as 1 platform.
  This platform then provides multiple CPO and eMSP roles.

[[terminology_terms]]
=== Terminology

[cols="3s,9",options="header"]
|===
|Term  |Description
|Broadcast Push | When communicating via a Hub, a data owner can do a single call to the Hub, the Hub then calls all receiving systems. +
                  See: <<transport_and_format_message_routing_broadcast_push,Broadcast push>>
|Charge Point |The physical system where an EV can be charged. A Charge Point has one or more EVSEs. Sometimes called Charging Station
|Client Owned Objects | In a normal REST interface the server is the owner of data, when a new resource is created by call POST, the server creates the URL where the resource can be found by a client. +
                        OCPI is different, in most modules the owner is the party pushing data to a server, to inform them of updates. +
                        For example Locations, the CPO owns a Location (Charge Point), when a new Charge Point is added, the CPO calls PUT on the eMSP systems to inform them about new locations. +
                        See: <<transport_and_format_client_owned_object_push,Client Owned Objects>>
|Configuration Module | OCPI Module needed to setup en maintain OCPI connections, but does not provide information for the EV driver:
                        <<credentials_credentials_endpoint,Credentials>>, <<versions_module,Versions>>
                        and <<mod_hub_client_info_module,Hub Client Info>>. +
                        Configuration Modules use <<transport_and_format_message_routing,message routing>>.
|Functional Module | OCPI Module that provides functionality/information for the EV Driver, such as: <<mod_tokens_tokens_module,Tokens>>,
                     <<mod_locations_locations_module,Locations>>, <<mod_cdrs_cdrs_module,CDRs>> etc. +
                     Functional Modules do NOT use message routing.
|Open Routing Request | This is for Platforms that are connected via a Hub. When a system send a pull request to the Hub,
                        and does not know, or care about, the owner of information, but asks the Hub to route the GET to the correct Platform.
                        The Hub finds the correct Platform and routes the request to that Platform. +
                        See: <<transport_and_format_message_routing_open_routing_request,Open Routing Request>>
|Platform | Software that provides services via OCPI.
            A platform can provide service for a single eMSP or CPO, or for multiple CPOs or eMSPs.
            It can even provide services for both eMSPs and CPOs at the same time.
|Pull | A system calls GET request to retrieve information from the system that owns the data.
|Push | The system (owning the data) actively calls POST/PUT/PATCH to update other systems with new/updated information.
|===


[[terminology_provider_and_operator_abbreviation]]
=== Provider and Operator abbreviation

In OCPI it is advised to use eMI3 compliant names for Contract IDs and EVSE IDs. The provider and the operator name is important here,
to target the right provider or operator, they need to be known upfront, at least between the cooperating parties.

In several standards, an issuing authority is mentioned that will keep a central registry of known Providers and Operators.
At this moment, the following countries have an authority that keeps track of the known providers and operators:

[[terminology_the_netherlands]]
==== The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg (BeNeLux)

The Dutch foundation, named http://www.eviolin.nl[eViolin] keeps the registry for The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.

* The list of operator IDs and provider IDs can be viewed on their website http://www.eviolin.nl/index.php/leden/[eViolin/Leden].

[[terminology_germany]]
==== Germany

The BDEW organisation keeps the registry for Germany in their general code number service https://bdew-codes.de/[bdew-codes.de].

* https://bdew-codes.de/Codenumbers/EMobilityId/ProviderIdList[Provider ID List] See https://bdew-codes.de/Codenumbers/EMobilityId/ProviderIdList[https://bdew-codes.de/Codenumbers/EMobilityId/ProviderIdList]
* https://bdew-codes.de/Codenumbers/EMobilityId/OperatorIdList[EVSE Operator ID List] See https://bdew-codes.de/Codenumbers/EMobilityId/OperatorIdList[https://bdew-codes.de/Codenumbers/EMobilityId/OperatorIdList]

[[terminology_austria]]
==== Austria

Austrian Mobile Power GmbH maintains a registry for Austria. This list is not publicly available.
For more information visit http://austrian-mobile-power.at/tools/id-vergabe/information/[austrian-mobile-power.at]

[[terminology_france]]
==== France

The AFIREV* organization will keep/keeps the registry for France. It provides operation Id for CPO and eMSP in compliance with eMI3 id structure. The prefix of these Ids is the “fr” country code. AFIREV will also be in charge of the definition of EVSE-Id structure, Charging-Pool-Id structure (location), and Contract-Id structure for France. AFIREV bases its requirements and recommendations on eMI3 definitions.

AFIREV stands for: Association Française pour l’Itinérance de la Recharge Électrique des Véhicules

[[terminology_charging_topology]]
=== Charging topology

The charging topology, as relevant to the eMSP, consists of three entities:

* _Connector_ is a specific socket or cable available for the EV to make use of.
* _EVSE_ is the part that controls the power supply to a single EV in a single session. An EVSE may provide multiple connectors but only one of these can be active at the same time.
* _Location_ is a group of one or more EVSEs that belong together geographically or spatially.

.Charging Topology schematic
image::images/topology.svg[Charging Topology schematic]

A Location is typically the exact location of one or more EVSEs, but it can also be the entrance of a parking garage or a gated community. It is up to the CPO to use whatever makes the most sense in a specific situation. Once arrived at the location, any further instructions to reach the EVSE from the Location are stored in the EVSE object itself (such as the floor number, visual identification or manual instructions).

[[terminology_variable_names]]
=== Variable names

To prevent issues with capitals in variable names, the naming in JSON is not CamelCase but snake_case. All variables are lowercase and include an underscore for a whitespace.

[[terminology_cardinality]]
=== Cardinality

When defining the cardinality of a field, the following symbols are used throughout this document:

[cols="1,9,1",options="header"]
|===
|Symbol |Description |Type 

|? |An optional object. If not set, it might be `null`, or the field might be omitted. When the field is omitted and it has a default value, the value is the default value. |Object 
|1 |Required object. |Object 
|* |A list of zero or more objects. If empty, it might be `null`, `[]` or the field might be omitted. |[Object] 
|+ |A list of at least one object. |[Object] 
|===


[[introduction_data_retention]]
=== Data Retention

OCPI does not specify how long a system should store data. Companies are RECOMMENDED to make this part of business contracts.
Parties also will need to oblige to local legislation.

==== Between OCPI version

When a new version of OCPI is implemented, the data exchanged via the old version does not have to be available via the newer version of OCPI.
Hence, the Version end-point will probably have different end-points per version. So when an object is stored with a URL that contains a version,
it is NOT REQUIRED to be available at a URL with a different version number.

<<<

[[supported_topologies]]
== Supported Topologies

OCPI started as a bilateral protocol, for peer-to-peer communication.
Soon parties started to use OCPI via Hubs, but OCPI 2.1.1 and earlier were not designed for that.
OCPI 2.2 introduces a solution for this: <<transport_and_format_message_routing,message routing>>.

OCPI 2.2 introduces Platforms that connect via OCPI instead of CPO and eMSP, more on this in: <<terminology_roles,EV Charging Market Roles>>

=== Peer-to-peer

The simplest topology is a bilateral connection: peer-to-peer between two platforms,
and in the most simple version each platform only has 1 role.

.peer-to-peer topology example
image::images/architecture_direct.svg[peer-to-peer topology example]


=== Multiple peer-to-peer connections

A more real-world topology where multiple parties connect their platforms
and each platform only has 1 role.
(Not every party necessarily connects with all the other parties with the other role).

.Multiple peer-to-peer topology example
image::images/architecture_multiple_direct_modified.svg[Multiple peer-to-peer topology example]

<<<
=== Peer-to-peer multiple the same roles

Some parties provide for example CPO or eMSP services for other companies.
So the platform hosts multiple parties with the same role.
This topology is a bilateral connection: peer-to-peer between two platforms,
and both platforms can have multiple roles.

.peer-to-peer with multiple roles topology example
image::images/architecture_platform_same_direct.svg[peer-to-peer with multiple roles topology example]


=== Peer-to-peer dual roles

Some parties have dual roles, most of the companies are CPO and eMSP.
This topology is a bilateral connection: peer-to-peer between two platforms,
and both platforms have the CPO and the eMSP roles.

.peer-to-peer with both CPO and eMSP roles topology example
image::images/architecture_platform_dual_direct.svg[peer-to-peer with both CPO and eMSP roles topology example]

<<<
=== Peer-to-peer mixed roles

Some parties have dual roles, or provide them to other parties and then connect to other companies that do the same.
This topology is a bilateral connection: peer-to-peer between two platforms,
and both platforms have multiple different and also the same roles.

.peer-to-peer with mixed roles topology example
image::images/architecture_platform_mixed_direct.svg[peer-to-peer with mixed roles topology example]

<<<
=== Multiple peer-to-peer

More a real-world topology when OCPI is used between market parties without a hub, all parties are platforms with multiple roles.

Disadvantage of this: requires a lot of connections between platforms to be setup, tested and maintained.

.peer-to-peer with mixed roles topology example
image::images/architecture_mutiple_platform_direct_modified.svg[peer-to-peer with mixed roles topology example]

<<<
=== Platforms via Hub

This topology has all Platforms only connect via a Hub, all communication goes via the Hub.

.Platforms connected via a Hub topology example
image::images/architecture_hub_simple_modified.svg[Platforms connected via a Hub topology example]

<<<
=== Platforms via Hub and direct

Not all Platforms will only communicate via a Hub.
There might be different reasons for Platforms to still have peer-to-peer connections.
The Hub might not yet support new functionality.
The Platforms use a custom module for some new project, which is not supported by the Hub.
etc.

[[transport_and_format_transport_and_format]]
== Transport and format

[[transport_and_format_json_http_implementation_guide]]
=== JSON / HTTP implementation guide

The OCPI protocol is based on HTTP and uses the JSON format. It follows a RESTful architecture for web services where possible.

[[transport_and_format_security_and_authentication]]
==== Security and authentication

The interfaces are protected on the HTTP transport level, with SSL and token-based authentication.
Please note that this mechanism does *not* require client-side certificates for authentication,
only server-side certificates to set up a secure SSL connection.


[[transport_and_format_authorization_header]]
==== Authorization header

Every OCPI HTTP request MUST add an 'Authorization' header. The header looks as follows:

[source]
----
  Authorization: Token IpbJOXxkxOAuKR92z0nEcmVF3Qw09VG7I7d/WCg0koM=
----

The literal 'Token' indicates that the token-based authentication mechanism is used, in OCPI this is called the 'credentials token'.
<<credentials_credentials_object,'Credentials tokens'>> are exchanged via the <<credentials_credentials_endpoint,credentials module>>.
These are different 'tokens' then the <<mod_tokens_token_object,Tokens>> exchanged via the <<mod_tokens_tokens_module,Token Module>>: Tokens used by drivers to authorize charging.
To prevent confusion, when talking about the token used here in the HTTP Authorization header, call them: 'Credentials Tokens'.

Its parameter is a string consisting of printable, non-whitespace ASCII characters.

The credentials token must uniquely identify the requesting party.
This way, the server can use the information in the Authorization header to link the request to the correct requesting party's account.

If the header is missing or the credentials token doesn't match any known party then the server SHALL respond with an HTTP `401 - Unauthorized` status code.

When a server receives a request with a valid <<credentials_registration,`CREDENTIALS_TOKEN_A`>>, on another module
then: <<credentials_credentials_endpoint,`credentials`>>
or <<versions_module,`versions`>>,
the server SHALL respond with an HTTP `401 - Unauthorized` status code.


[[transport_and_format_pull_and_push]]
==== Pull and Push

OCPI supports both *Pull* and *Push* models. 

* *Push:* Changes in objects and new objects are sent (semi) real-time to the receiver.
* *Pull:* Receiver request a (full) list of objects every X times.

OCPI doesn't require parties to implement Push.
Pull is required, a receiver needs to be able to get _in-sync_ after a period of connection loss.

It is possible to implement a Pull only OCPI implementation, it might be a good starting point for an OCPI implementation.
However, it is strongly advised to implement Push for production systems that have to handle some load,
especially when several clients are requesting long lists frequently.
Push implementations tend to use fewer resources.
It is therefore advised to clients _pulling_ lists from a server to do this on a relative low polling interval: think in hours, not minutes,
and to introduce some splay (randomize the length of the poll interface a bit).


[[transport_and_format_request_format]]
==== Request format

The request method can be any of <<transport_and_format_get,GET>>, POST, <<transport_and_format_put,PUT>>, <<transport_and_format_patch,PATCH>> or DELETE. The OCPI protocol uses them in a way similar to REST APIs.

[cols="2,12",options="header"]
|===
|Method |Description

|<<transport_and_format_get,GET>> |Fetches objects or information. 
|POST |Creates new objects or information. 
|<<transport_and_format_put,PUT>> |Updates existing objects or information. 
|<<transport_and_format_patch,PATCH>> |Partially updates existing objects or information. 
|DELETE |Removes existing objects or information. 
|===

The HTTP header: Content-Type SHALL be set to `application/json` for any request that contains a message body: POST, PUT and PATCH.
When no body is present, probably in a GET or DELETE, then the Content-Type header MAY be omitted.


[[transport_and_format_get]]
===== GET

A server is not required to return all objects to a client, the server might for example not send all CDRs to a client,
because some CDRs do not belong to this client. 

When a client receives objects from the server that contain invalid JSON or invalid OCPI objects (For example: missing fields),
the client has no way of letting this know to the server. It is advised to log these errors and contact the server administrator about this.
When a list of objects contains some objects that are correct and some with 'problems' the client should at least process the correct OCPI objects. 

[[transport_and_format_pagination]]
====== Pagination

All GET methods that return a list of objects have pagination, this allows a client and server to control the number of objects
returned in the response to a GET request, while still enabling the client to retrieve all objects by doing multiple requests
with different parameters. Without pagination, the server had to return all objects in one response that could potentially contain millions of objects.

To enable pagination of the returned list of objects, additional URL parameters are allowed for the GET request and additional
headers need to be added to the response.

[[transport_and_format_paginated_request]]
====== Paginated Request

The following table lists all the parameters that have to be supported but might be omitted by a client request.

[cols="2,2,12",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Datatype |Description

|date_from |<<types_datetime_type,DateTime>> |Only return objects that have `last_updated` after or equal to this Date/Time (inclusive).
|date_to |<<types_datetime_type,DateTime>> |Only return objects that have `last_updated` up to this Date/Time, but not including (exclusive).
|offset |int |The offset of the first object returned. Default is 0 (the first object).
|limit |int |The maximum number of objects to GET. The server might decide to return fewer objects, either because there are no more objects, or the server limits the maximum number of objects to return. This is to prevent, for example, overloading the system.
|===

The `date_from` is inclusive and `date_to` exclusive, this way, when sequential requests with to the same end-point are done,
the next interval will have no overlap and the `date_from` of the next interval is simply the `date_to` of the previous interval.

Example: With offset=0 and limit=10 the server shall return the first 10 records (if 10 objects match the request). Then the next page starts with offset=10.

[[transport_and_format_paginated_response]]
====== Paginated Response

For pagination to work correctly, it is important that multiple calls to the same URL (including query parameters):
result in the same objects being returned by the server.
For this to be the case, the sequence of objects mustn't change, or as little as possible.
It is best practice to return the oldest (by creation date, not the `last_updated` field) first.
While a client crawls over the pages (multiple GET requests every time to the 'next' page Link), a new object might be created on the server.
The client detects this: the `X-Total-Count` will be higher on the next call.
But the client doesn't have to correct for this. Only the last page will be different (or an additional page).
So the client will not be required to crawl all pages all over again
when the client has reached to last page it has retrieved all relevant pages and is up to date.

NOTE: Some query parameters can cause concurrency problems. For example the `date_to` query parameter.
When there are for example 1000 objects matching a query for all objects with `date_to` before 2016-01-01.
While crawling over the pages one of these objects is updated.
The client detects this: `X-Total-Count` will be lower in the next request.
It is advised to redo the previous GET but then with the `offset` lowered by 1 (if the `offset` was not 0)
and after that continue crawling the 'next' page links.
When an object before this page has been updated, then the client has missed 1 object.

HTTP headers that have to be added to any paginated GET response.

[cols="3,2,10",options="header"]
|===
|HTTP Header |Datatype |Description

|Link |String |Link to the 'next' page should be provided when this is NOT the last page.
       The Link should also contain any filters present in the original request. See the examples below.
|X-Total-Count |int |(Custom HTTP Header) The total number of objects available in the server system that match the given query
                (including the given query parameters, for example: `date_to` and `date_from` but excluding `limit` and `offset`)
                and that are available to this client. For example: The CPO server might return less CDR objects to an eMSP then the total number of CDRs available in the CPO system.
|X-Limit |int |(Custom HTTP Header) The maximum number of objects that the server can return.
          Note that this is an upper limit. If there are not enough remaining objects to return,
          fewer objects than this upper limit number will be returned, X-Limit SHALL then still show the upper limit, not the number of objects returned.
|===


[[transport_and_format_pagination_examples]]
====== Pagination Examples

Example of a required OCPI pagination link header:

[source]
----
  Link: <https://www.server.com/ocpi/cpo/2.2/cdrs/?offset=150&limit=50>; rel="next"
----

After the client has called the given "next" page URL above the Link parameter will most likely look like this:

[source]
----
  Link: <https://www.server.com/ocpi/cpo/2.2/cdrs/?offset=200&limit=50>; rel="next"
----

Example of a query with filters: Client does a GET to: 

[source]
----
  https://www.server.com/ocpi/cpo/2.2/cdrs/?date_from=2016-01-01T00:00:00Z&date_to=2016-12-31T23:59:59Z
----

The server should return (when the server has enough objects and the limit is the amount of objects the server wants to send is 100.)
_(This example should have been on 1 line, but didn't fit the paper width.)_ 

[source]
----
  Link: <https://www.server.com/ocpi/cpo/2.2/cdrs/?offset=100
                 &limit=100&date_from=2016-01-01T00:00:00Z&date_to=2016-12-31T23:59:59Z>; rel="next"
----

Example of a server limiting the amount of objects returned: Client does a GET to:

[source]
----
  https://www.server.com/ocpi/cpo/2.2/cdrs/?limit=2000
----

The server should return (when the server has enough objects and the limit is the amount of objects the server wants to send is 100.) The `X-Limit` HTTP header should be set to 100 as well.

  Link: <https://www.server.com/ocpi/cpo/2.2/cdrs/?offset=100&limit=100>; rel="next"
----

[[transport_and_format_put]]
===== PUT

A PUT request must specify all required fields of an object (similar to a POST request).
Optional fields that are not included will revert to their default value which is either specified in the protocol or NULL.

[[transport_and_format_patch]]
===== PATCH

A PATCH request must only specify the object's identifier (if needed to identify this object) and the fields to be updated. Any fields (both required or optional) that are left out remain unchanged.

The MIME-type of the request body is: `application/json` and may contain the data as documented for each endpoint.

In case a PATCH request fails, the client is expected to call the <<transport_and_format_get,GET>> method to check the state of the object in the other party's system. If the object doesn't exist, the client should do a <<transport_and_format_put,PUT>>. 

[[transport_and_format_client_owned_object_push]]
==== Client Owned Object Push

Normal client/server RESTful services work in a way where the Server is the owner of the objects that are created.
The client requests a POST method with an object to the end-point URL.
The response sent by the server will contain the URL to the new object.
The client will request only one server to create a new object, not multiple servers.

Many OCPI modules work differently: the client is the owner of the object
and only pushes the information to one or more servers for information sharing purposes.
For example the CPO owns the Tariff objects and pushes them to a couple of eMSPs,
so each eMSP gains knowledge of the tariffs that the CPO will charge them for their customers' sessions.
eMSP might receive Tariff objects from multiple CPOs.
They need to be able to make a distinction between the different tariffs from different CPOs.

The distinction between objects from different CPOs/eMSPs is made based on
a {<<credentials_credentials_object,country_code>>}
and {<<credentials_credentials_object,party_id>>}.
The <<credentials_credentials_object,country_code>>
and <<credentials_credentials_object,party_id>>
of the other party are received during the <<credentials_credentials_endpoint,credentials>> handshake,
so that a server might know the values a client will use in an URL.

Client Owned Object URL definition: {base-ocpi-url}/{end-point}/{country-code}/{party-id}/{object-id}

Example of a URL to a Client Owned Object

[source]
----
  https://www.server.com/ocpi/cpo/2.2/tariffs/NL/TNM/14
----

POST is not supported for these kinds of modules.
PUT is used to send new objects to the servers. 

If a client tries to access an object with a URL that has a different
<<credentials_credentials_object,country_code>>
and/or <<credentials_credentials_object,party_id>>
then given during the <<credentials_credentials_endpoint,credentials>> handshake,
it is allowed the respond with an HTTP `404` status code, this way blocking client access to objects that do not belong to them.

To identify the owner of data, the party generating the information that is provided to other parties via OCPI,
a 'Data owner' is provided at the beginning of every module that has a clear owner.

[[transport_and_format_errors]]
===== Errors

When a client pushes a Client Owned Object, but the {object-id} in the URL is different from the id in the object being pushed,
server implementations are advised to return an <<status_codes_status_codes,OCPI status code>>:
<<status_codes_status_codes,2001>>.

[[transport_and_format_response_format]]
==== Response format
The content that is sent with all the response messages is an 'application/json' type and contains a JSON object with the following properties:

[cols="3,2,1,10",options="header"]
|===
|Property |Type |Card. |Description 

|data |Array or Object or String |* or ? |Contains the actual response data object or list of objects from each request, depending on the cardinality of the response data, this is an array (card. * or +), or a single object (card. 1 or ?) 
|status_code |int |1 |OCPI status code, as listed in <<status_codes_status_codes,Status Codes>>, indicates how the request was handled. To avoid confusion with HTTP codes, OCPI status codes consist of four digits.
|status_message |<<types_string_type,string>> |? |An optional status message which may help when debugging. 
|timestamp |<<types_datetime_type,DateTime>> |1 |The time this message was generated. 
|===

For brevity's sake, any further examples used in this specification will only contain the value of the "data" field. In reality, it will always have to be wrapped in the above response format.

When a request cannot be accepted, an HTTP error response code is expected, including the response format above, that contains more details. HTTP status codes are described on http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html[w3.org].

[[transport_and_format_message_routing]]
==== Message Routing

When the development of OCPI was started, it was designed for peer-to-peer communication between CPO and eMSP.
This has advantages, but also disadvantages.
Having to set up and maintain OCPI connections to a lot of parties requires more effort than doing it for only a couple of connections.
By communication via one or more Hubs, the amount of OCPI connections is reduced,
while still being able to offer roaming to a lot of different parties and customers.

With the introduction of Message Routing, OCPI is now better usable for communication via Hubs.

All examples/sequence diagrams in this section use the roles CPO and eMSP as examples, they could be switched, it could be other roles.

===== Platforms
With Message Routing functionality it also becomes possible to support Platforms that host multiple roles.
A lot of parties are not only CPO or eMSP. Most are both CPO and eMSP.
Some parties are doing business in multiple counties, which means to operate with different `country_codes`
Some parties have a platform on which the host service for other CPOs/eMSPs.
Some parties are themselves CPO and host CPO services for others,
but other parties are (themselves) not a CPO or other role in the EV charging landscape
but do provide service to CPOs/eMSPs, etc.

===== Message Routing Headers
When OCPI is used to communicate to/from a Platform or via a Hub (which is almost always the case)
the following four HTTP headers are to be added to any request/response to allow messages to be routed.

When implementing OCPI these four headers SHALL be implemented for any request/response to/from a Functional Module.
This does not mean they have to be present in all request.
There are situation/special request where some headers can or shall be omitted, more on this later.

Only requests/responses from Function Modules: such as: <<mod_tokens_tokens_module,Tokens>>,
<<mod_locations_locations_module,Locations>>, <<mod_cdrs_cdrs_module,CDRs>> etc.
SHALL be routed, so need the routing headers.

The requests/responses to/from Configuration Modules: <<credentials_credentials_endpoint,Credentials>>,
<<versions_module,Versions>> and
<<mod_hub_client_info_module,Hub Client Info>> are not to be routed, and are for Platform-to-Platform
or Platform-to-Hub communication. Thus reading headers SHALL NOT be used with these modules.

[[transport_and_format_message_routing_broadcast_push]]
===== Broadcast Push

For simplicity, connected clients might push (POST, PUT, PATCH) information to all connected clients with an "opposite role",
for example: CPO pushing information to all eMSPs and NSPs, eMSP pushing information to all CPOs.
(The role "Other" is seen as an eMSP type of role, so Broadcast Push from a CPO is also sent to "Other".
Messages from "Other" are only sent to CPOs and not to eMSPs though.)

When using Broadcast Push, the Hub broadcasts received information to all connected clients.
To send data through a Hub might be very useful to share information like Locations or Tokens with all parties
connected to the Hub that have implemented the corresponding module.
This means only one request to the Hub will be necessary, as all connected clients will be served by the Hub.

To send a Broadcast Push, the client uses the party-id and country-code of the Hub in the 'OCPI-to-' headers.
The Hub parses the request and sends a response to the client, which optionally contains its own party-id and country-code in the 'OCPI-from-' headers.
The Hub then sends the pushed data to any client implementing the corresponding applicable module, using its own party-id and country-code in the 'OCPI-from-' headers.
The client receiving a Push from a Hub (with the Hubs information in the 'OCPI-from-' headers) will respond to
this Push with the Hubs party-id and country-code in the 'OCPI-to-' headers.

GET SHALL NOT be used in combination with Broadcast Push.
If the requesting party wants to GET information of which it does not know the receiving party,
an <<transport_and_format_message_routing_open_routing_request,Open Routing Request>> MUST be used. (see below)

Broadcast Push SHALL only be used with information that is meant to be sent to all other parties. It is useful to share data like
<<mod_tokens_tokens_module,Tokens>> and <<mod_locations_locations_module,Locations>>,
but not so much for <<mod_cdrs_cdrs_module,CDRs>> and <<mod_sessions_sessions_module,Sessions>>
as these pieces of information are specific to only one party and are possibly even protected by GDPR or other laws.

NOTE: For "Client Owned Objects", the party-id and country-code in the URL segments will still be the original party-id and country-code from the original client sending the Broadcast Push to the Hub.

.Example sequence diagram of a Broadcast Push from a CPO to multiple eMSPs.
image::images/sd_put_boardcast.svg[OCPI Sequence Diagram of a Broadcast Push from a CPO to multiple eMSPs]


[[transport_and_format_message_routing_open_routing_request]]
===== Open Routing Request
When a Hub has the intelligence to route messages based on the content of the request,
or the requesting party does not know the destination of a request, the 'OCPI-to-' headers can be omitted in the request towards the Hub.
The Hub can then decide to which party a request needs to be routed, or that it needs to be broadcasted if the destination cannot be determined.

This has nothing to do with <<transport_and_format_message_routing_broadcast_push,Broadcast Push>> though,
as <<transport_and_format_message_routing_broadcast_push,Broadcast Push>> only works for the <<transport_and_format_pull_and_push,Push model>>,
not for <<transport_and_format_get,GET>> requests.

Open Routing Requests are possible for GET (<<transport_and_format_get_all_via_hubs,Not GET ALL>>), POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE.

.Example sequence diagram of a open routing GET from a CPO via the Hub.
image::images/sd_get_openrouting.svg[Example sequence diagram of a open routing GET from a CPO via the Hub]


[[transport_and_format_get_all_via_hubs]]
===== GET All via Hubs
A client (Receiver) can request a GET on the Sender interface of a module implemented by a Hub.
To request a GET All from a Hub, the client uses the party-id and country-code of the Hub in the 'OCPI-to-' headers,
and calls the GET method on the Sender interface of a module.

The Hub can then combine objects from different connected parties and return them to the client.

The client can determine the owner of the objects by looking at the `county_code` and `party_id` in the individual objects returned by the hub.

===== Overview of required/optional routing headers for different scenarios

===== Timestamps and Objects send via Hubs
When OCPI Objects are sent via Hubs, the `last_updated` fields SHALL NOT be updated by the Hub.


[[transport_and_format_unique_messageg_ids]]
=== Unique message IDs

For debugging issues, OCPI implementations are required to include unique IDs via HTTP headers in every request/response.

[cols="3,10",options="header"]
|===
|HTTP Header |Description

|X-Request-ID     |Every request SHALL contain a unique request ID, the response to this request SHALL contain the same ID.
|X-Correlation-ID |Every request/response SHALL contain a unique correlation ID, every response to this request SHALL contain the same ID.
|===

It is advised to used GUID/UUID as values for X-Request-ID and X-Correlation-ID.

When a Hub forwards a request to a party, the request to this party SHALL contain a new unique value in the X-Request-ID HTTP header,
not a copy of the X-Request-ID HTTP header taken from the incoming request that is being forwarded.

When a Hub forwards a request to a party, the request SHALL contain the same X-Correlation-ID HTTP header (with the same value).

[[transport_and_format_interface_endpoints]]
=== Interface endpoints

As OCPI contains multiple interfaces. Different endpoints are available for messaging.
The protocol is designed such that the exact URLs of the endpoints can be defined by each party.
It also supports an interface per version.

The locations of all the version-specific endpoints can be retrieved by fetching the API information from the versions endpoint.
Each version-specific endpoint will then list the available endpoints for that version.
It is strongly recommended to insert the protocol version into the URL.

For example: `/ocpi/cpo/2.2/locations` and `/ocpi/emsp/2.2/locations`.

The URLs of the endpoints in this document are descriptive only. The exact URL can be found by fetching the endpoint information from the API info endpoint and looking up the identifier of the endpoint.

[[transport_and_format_offline_behaviour]]
=== Offline behaviour

During communication over OCPI, one of the communicating parties might be unreachable for an undefined amount of time.
OCPI works event-based, new messages and status are pushed from one party to another. When communication is lost, updates cannot be delivered.

OCPI messages SHOULD NOT be queued. When a client does a POST, PUT or PATCH request and that request fails or times out,
the client should not queue the message and retry the same message again later. 

When the connection is re-established, it is up to the target-server of a connection to
GET the current status from to source-server to get back to a synchronized state.

For example:

- CDRs of the period of communication loss can be retrieved with a GET command on the CDRs module, with filters to retrieve only CDRs of the period since the last CDR has been received.
- Status of EVSEs (or Locations) can be retrieved by calling a GET on the Locations module.

<<<

[[status_codes_status_codes]]
== Status codes

There are two types of status codes:

- Transport related (HTTP)
- Content related (OCPI)

The transport layer ends after a message is correctly parsed into a (semantically unvalidated) JSON structure.
When a message does not contain a valid JSON string, the HTTP error `400 - Bad request` MUST be returned.

If a request is syntactically valid JSON and addresses an existing resource, a HTTP error MUST NOT be returned.
Those requests are supposed to have reached the OCPI layer. 

In case of a GET request, when the resource does NOT exist, the server SHOULD return a HTTP `404 - Not Found`.

When the server receives a valid OCPI object it SHOULD respond with:

* HTTP `200 - Ok` when the object already existed and has successfully been updated.
* HTTP `201 - Created` when the object has been newly created in the server system.

Requests that reach the OCPI layer SHOULD return an OCPI response message with a `status_code` field as defined below.

Custom status code range values SHALL NOT be used by standard OCPI module as described in this document!
When custom status codes are used, keep in mind that different custom modules could use the same values with a different meaning,
as they are not standardized.

|===
|Range |Description 

|1xxx |Success 
|2xxx |Client errors – The data sent by the client can not be processed by the server 
|3xxx |Server errors – The server encountered an internal error 
|===

When the status code is in the success range (1xxx), the `data` field in the response message SHOULD contain the information as specified in the protocol. Otherwise the `data` field is unspecified and MAY be omitted, set to `null` or something else that could help to debug the problem from a programmer's perspective. For example, it could specify which fields contain an error or are missing.

*Type:* Configuration Module

This is the required base module of OCPI. This module is the starting point for any OCPI connection.
Via this module, clients can learn <<version_information_endpoint_version_information_endpoint,which versions>>
of OCPI a server supports, and <<version_information_endpoint_version_details_endpoint,which modules>> it supports for each of the versions.

[[version_information_endpoint_version_information_endpoint]]
=== Version information endpoint

This endpoint lists all the available OCPI versions and the corresponding URLs to
where version specific details such as the supported endpoints can be found.

Endpoint structure definition:

No structure defined. This is open for every party to define themselves.

Examples:

[[version_information_endpoint_version_details_endpoint]]
=== Version details endpoint

Via the version details, the parties can exchange which modules are implemented for a specific version of OCPI,
which interface role is implemented, and what the endpoint URL is for this interface.

Parties that are both CPO and eMSP (or a Hub) can implement one version endpoint that covers both roles.
With the information that is available in the version details, parties don't need to implement a separate endpoint per role (CPO or eMSP) anymore.
In practice this means that when a company is both a CPO and an eMSP and it connects to another party that implements both interfaces, only one OCPI connection is needed.

NOTE: OCPI 2.2 introduces the role field in the version details.
Older versions of OCPI do not support this.

Endpoint structure definition:

No structure defined. This is open for every party to define themselves.

Examples:

`+https://www.server.com/ocpi/cpo/2.2+`

`+https://www.server.com/ocpi/emsp/2.2+`

This endpoint lists the supported endpoints and their URLs for a specific OCPI version. To notify the other party that the list of endpoints of your current version has changed, you can send a PUT request to the corresponding credentials endpoint (see the credentials chapter).

Both the CPO and the eMSP MUST implement this endpoint.

[[credentials_credentials_endpoint]]
== _Credentials_ module

*Module Identifier: `credentials`*

*Type:* Configuration Module

The credentials module is used to exchange the credentials token that has to be used by parties for authorization of requests.

Every OCPI request is required to contain a credentials token in the <<transport_and_format_authorization_header,HTTP Authorization header>>.


[[credentials_use_cases]]
=== Use cases

[[credentials_registration]]
==== Registration

To start using OCPI, the Platforms will need to exchange credentials tokens.

To start the exchange of credentials tokens, one platform has to be selected as Sender for the Credentials module.
This has to be decided between the Platforms (outside of OCPI) before they first connect.

To start the credentials exchange, the Receiver Platform must create a unique credentials token: `CREDENTIALS_TOKEN_A`
that has to be used to authorize the Sender until the credentials exchange is finished.
This credentials token along with the versions endpoint SHOULD be sent to the Sender in a secure way that is outside the scope of this protocol.

The Sender starts the registration process, retrieves the version information and details (using `CREDENTIALS_TOKEN_A` in the HTTP Authorization header).
The Sender generates a unique credentials token: `CREDENTIALS_TOKEN_B`, sends it to the Receiver in a POST request to the `credentials` module of the Receiver.
The Receiver stores `CREDENTIALS_TOKEN_B` and uses it for any requests to the Sender Platform, including the version information and details.

The Receiver generates a unique credentials token: `CREDENTIALS_TOKEN_C` and returns it to the Sender in the response to the POST request from the Sender.

After the credentials exchange has finished, the Sender SHALL use `CREDENTIALS_TOKEN_C` in future OCPI request to the Receiver Platform.
The `CREDENTIALS_TOKEN_A` can then be thrown away, it MAY no longer be used.

(In the sequence diagrams below we use relative paths as short resource identifiers to illustrate API endpoints;
please note that they should be absolute URLs in any working implementation of OCPI.)

.The OCPI registration process
image::images/registration-sequence.svg[The OCPI registration process]

Due to its symmetric nature of the credentials module, any platform can be Sender and or the Receiver for this module.


[[credentials_updating_to_a_newer_version]]
==== Updating to a newer version

At some point, both platforms will have implemented a newer OCPI version.
To start using the newer version,
one platform has to send a PUT request to the credentials endpoint of the other platform.

.The OCPI update process
image::images/update-sequence.svg[The OCPI update process]

[[credentials_changing_endpoints_for_the_current_version]]
==== Changing endpoints for the current version

This can be done by following the update procedure for the same version.

By sending a PUT request to the credentials endpoint of this version,
the other platform will fetch and store the corresponding set of endpoints.


[[credentials_updating_the_credentials_and_resetting_the_token]]
==== Updating the credentials and resetting the credentials token

The credentials (or parts thereof, such as the credentials token) can be updated by sending the new credentials via
a PUT request to the credentials endpoint of the current version, similar to the update procedure described above.

Security advices:
When one of the connecting platforms suspects that a credentials token is compromised, that platform SHALL initiate a credentials token update as soon as possible.
It is advisable to renew the credentials tokens at least once a month, in case it was not detected that the credentials where compromised.

[[credentials_errors_during_registration]]
==== Errors during registration

When the server connects back to the client during the credentials registration, it might encounter problems.
When this happens, the server should add the status code <<status_codes_3xxx_server_errors,3001>>
in the response to the POST from the client.

[[credentials_required_endpoints_not_available]]
==== Required endpoints not available

When two platforms connect, it might happen that one of the platforms expects a certain endpoint to be available at the other platform.

For example: a Platform with a CPO role could only want to connect when the CDRs endpoint is available in an platform with an eMSP role.

In case the Sender (starting the credentials exchange process) cannot find the endpoints it expects,
it is expected NOT to send the POST request with credentials to the Receiver.
Log a message/notify the administrator to contact the administrator of the Receiver platform.

In case the Receiver platform that cannot find the endpoints it expects,
then it is expected to respond to the request with the status code <<status_codes_3xxx_server_errors,3003>>.


[[credentials_interfaces_and_endpoints]]
=== Interfaces and endpoints

The Credentials module is different from all other OCPI modules.
This module is symmetric, it has to be implemented by all OCPI implementations, and all implementations need to be able call
this module on any other platform, and have to be able the handle receiving the request from another party.

Example: `/ocpi/2.2/credentials` and `/ocpi/emsp/2.2/credentials`

|<<credentials_delete_method,DELETE>> |Informs the server that its credentials to the client's system are now invalid (i.e. unregister). 
|===

[[credentials_get_method]]
==== *GET* Method

Retrieves the credentials object to access the server's platform. The request body is empty, the response contains the credentials object to access the server's platform. This credentials object also contains extra information about the server such as its business details.

[[credentials_post_method]]
==== *POST* Method

Provides the server with credentials to access the client's system. This credentials object also contains extra information about the client such as its business details.

A `POST` initiates the registration process for this endpoint's version. The server must also fetch the client's endpoints for this version.

If successful, the server must generate a new credentials token and respond with the client's new credentials to access the server's system. The credentials object in the response also contains extra information about the server such as its business details.

This method MUST return a `HTTP status code 405: method not allowed` if the client has already been registered before.

[[credentials_put_method]]
==== *PUT* Method

Provides the server with updated credentials to access the client's system. This credentials object also contains extra information about the client such as its business details.

A `PUT` will switch to the version that contains this credentials endpoint if it's different from the current version. The server must fetch the client's endpoints again, even if the version has not changed.

If successful, the server must generate a new credentials token for the client and respond with the client's updated credentials to access the server's system. The credentials object in the response also contains extra information about the server such as its business details.

This method MUST return a `HTTP status code 405: method not allowed` if the client has not been registered yet.

[[credentials_delete_method]]
==== *DELETE* Method

Informs the server that its credentials to access the client's system are now invalid and can no longer be used. Both parties must end any automated communication. This is the unregistration process.

This method MUST return a `HTTP status code 405: method not allowed` if the client has not been registered before.

|Property |Type |Card. |Description 

|token |<<types_string_type,string>>(64) |1 |Case Sensitive, ASCII only. The credentials token for the other party to authenticate in your system. (Not encoded in Base64 or any other encoding)
|url |<<types_url_type,URL>> |1 |The URL to your API versions endpoint. 
|roles |<<credentials_credentials_role_class,CredentialsRole>> |+ |List of the roles this party provides.
|===

Every role needs a unique combination of: `role`, `party_id` and `country_code`.

A party can have the same role more than once, for example when a CPO provides 'white-label' services for 'virtual' CPOs.

One or more roles and thus `party_id` and `country_code` sets are provided here to inform a server about the `party_id` and `country_code`
sets a client will use when pushing <<transport_and_format_client_owned_object_push,Client Owned Objects>>.
This helps a server to determine the URLs a client will use when pushing
a <<transport_and_format_client_owned_object_push,Client Owned Object>>.
The `country_code` is added the make certain the URL used when pushing
a <<transport_and_format_client_owned_object_push,Client Owned Object>> is unique as
there might be multiple parties in the world with the same `party_id`. The combination of `country_id` and `party_id` should always be unique though.
A party operating in multiple countries can always use the home country of the company for all connections.

For example: EVSE IDs can be pushed under the country and provider identification of a company, even if the EVSEs are actually located in a different country.
This way it is not necessary to establish one OCPI connection per country a company operates in.

The `party_id` and `country_code` given here have no direct link with the eMI3 EVSE IDs and Contract IDs that might be used in the different OCPI modules.
A party implementing OCPI MAY push EVSE IDs with an eMI3 `spot operator` different from the OCPI `party_id` and/or the `country_code`.

[[mod_locations_locations_module]]
== _Locations_ module

*Module Identifier: `locations`*

*Data owner: `CPO`*

*Type:* Functional Module

The Location objects live in the CPO back-end system. They describe the charging locations of an operator.

*Module dependency:* the Receiver endpoint is dependent on the <<mod_tariffs_tariffs_module,Tariffs module>>

[[mod_locations_flow_and_lifecycle]]
=== Flow and Lifecycle

The Locations module has the <<mod_locations_location_object,Location>> as base object. 
Each Location can have multiple EVSEs (1:n) and each EVSE can have multiple Connectors (1:n).
With the methods in the <<mod_locations_emsp_interface,Receiver interface>>,
Location data and status information can be shared with for example an eMSP and NSP.
Updates can be made to a whole Location, but also only to an EVSE or a single Connector.

When a CPO creates Location objects, it pushes them to connected eMSP by calling <<mod_locations_put_method,PUT>> on the Receivers Locations endpoint.
eMSPs who do not support Push mode need to call <<mod_locations_get_method,GET>> on the CPOs Locations endpoint to receive the new object.
This should be done regularly to stay up to date with the CPOs data, but not too often in order to keep the load low.

If the CPO wants to replace a Location related object,
they again push it to the eMSP systems by calling <<mod_locations_put_method,PUT>> on their Locations endpoint.

Any changes to a Location related object can also be pushed to connected eMSPs by calling the <<mod_locations_patch_method,PATCH>> method
on the eMSPs Locations endpoint, but using PATCH mode, only actual changes should be pushed.
Providers who do not support Push mode need to call <<mod_locations_get_method,GET>> on the CPOs Locations endpoint to receive the updates.

When the CPO wants to delete an EVSE from the list of active EVSEs, they MUST update the EVSE's `status` field to `REMOVED`
and call the <<mod_locations_put_method,PUT>> or <<mod_locations_patch_method,PATCH>> on the eMSP system.
A Location without any valid EVSE object can be considered expired and should no longer be displayed.
There is no way to entirely delete Locations, EVSEs and Connectors as there are other modules like 
<<mod_sessions_sessions_module,`sessions`>> that depend on them. 
If it was possible to remove these objects, those links would no longer work.

When the CPO is not sure about the state or existence of a Location, EVSE or Connector object in the eMSP's system,
the CPO can perform a <<mod_locations_get_method_eMSP,GET>> request to validate the object in the eMSP's system.

Private charging Locations, that are not to be used for public charging, SHALL NOT be published via OCPI.


==== No public charging or roaming

When a Location is not available for either Public Charging or Roaming,
it is RECOMMENDED to NOT send that Location via OCPI to receiving parties.

==== Group of Charge Points

OCPP 2.0 supports a 3-tier model:

- Highest level is a Charge Point
- A Charge Point can have one or more EVSEs.
- Every EVSE can have one or more Connectors.

OCPI does not have this model:

- OCPI has Location at the highest level.
- Each location can have multiple EVSE
- Every EVSE can have one or more Connectors.

When mapping OCPP Charge Points to OCPI, there are 2 options:

- One Location for a group of Charge Points at the same location. (preferred)
- One Location per Charge Point at the same location.

OCPI prefers the first method. An EV driver does not care if a Location consists of one Charge Point with a very large amount of EVSEs,
or a large amount of Charge Points with only one EVSE. The EV driver wants to known how many EVSEs are available.
Grouping Charge Points in the same location into one OCPI Location will show better on a map that shows Charging Locations.

NOTE: The definition, an EVSE can only charge one EV at a time.

==== OCPP 1.x Charge Points with multiple connectors per EVSE

OCPP 1.x was not designed to support the 3-tier model. It had no notion of EVSEs.
The Open Charge Alliance has written an Application Note: "Multiple Connectors per EVSE in a OCPP 1.x implementation"

The workaround:

- Define one 'virtual' EVSE per Connector.
- When a connector of an hardware EVSE becomes unavailable, set all 'virtual' EVSEs for all the connectors of the hardware EVSE to unavailable. etc.


[[mod_locations_interfaces_and_endpoints]]
=== Interfaces and endpoints

There are both, a Sender and a Receiver interface for Locations.
It is advised to use the Push direction from Sender to Receiver during normal operation in order to keep the latency of updates low.
The Sender interface is meant to be used when the connection between two parties is established for the first time,
to retrieve the current list of Location objects with the current status,
and when the Receiver is not 100% sure the Location cache is entirely up-to-date (i.e. to perform a full sync).
The Receiver can also use the Sender <<mod_locations_get_object_request_parameters,GET Object interface>> to retrieve a specific Location, EVSE or Connector.
This feature might be used by an Receiver that wants information about a specific Location, but has not implemented the Receiver Locations interface (i.e. cannot receive Push).

`+https://www.server.com/ocpi/cpo/2.2/locations/?offset=50&limit=100+`


If the optional parameters `{date_from}` and/or `{date_to}` are provided, only Locations with 
(`last_updated`) between the given `{date_from}` (including) and `{date_to}` (excluding) will be returned.
In order for this to work properly, the following logic MUST be implemented accordingly:
If an EVSE is updated, also the 'parent' Location's `last_updated` field needs to be updated. 
Similarly, if a Connector is updated, the EVSE's `last_updated` and the Location's `last_updated` fields need to be updated.

This request is <<transport_and_format_pagination,paginated>>, it supports the <<transport_and_format_paginated_request,pagination>> related URL parameters.

[[mod_locations_emsp_interface]]
==== Receiver Interface

Typically implemented by market roles like: eMSP and NSP.

Locations are <<transport_and_format_client_owned_object_push,Client Owned Objects>>,
so the end-points need to contain the required extra fields: 
{<<credentials_credentials_object,party_id>>} and {<<credentials_credentials_object,country_code>>}.

Endpoint structure definition:

`{locations_endpoint_url}/{country_code}/{party_id}/{location_id}[/{evse_uid}][/{connector_id}]`

|===

[[mod_locations_get_method_eMSP]]
===== *GET* Method

If the CPO wants to check the status of a Location, EVSE or Connector object in the eMSP system,
it might GET the object from the eMSP system for validation purposes.
The CPO is the owner of the objects, so it would be illogical if the eMSP system had a different status or was missing an object.
If a discrepancy is found, the CPO might push an update to the eMSP via a <<mod_locations_put_method,PUT>> or <<mod_locations_patch_method,PATCH>> call.

[[mod_locations_request_parameters]]

[[mod_locations_put_method]]
===== *PUT* Method

The CPO pushes available Location, EVSE or Connector objects to the eMSP.
PUT can be used to send new Location objects to the eMSP but also to replace existing Locations.

When the PUT only contains a <<mod_locations_connector_object,Connector>> Object,
the Receiver SHALL also set the new `last_updated` value on the parent <<mod_locations_evse_object,EVSE>> and <<mod_locations_location_object,Location>> Objects.

When the PUT only contains a <<mod_locations_evse_object,EVSE>> Object,
the Receiver SHALL also set the new `last_updated` value on the parent <<mod_locations_location_object,Location>> Object.

[[mod_locations_request_parameters_msp]]

|===

[[mod_locations_example_add_an_evse]]
====== Example: add an EVSE

To add an _EVSE_, simply put the full object in an update message, including all its required fields.
Since the id will be new to the eMSP's system, the receiving party will know that it is a new object.
When not all required fields are specified, the object may be discarded.

[[mod_locations_patch_method]]
===== *PATCH* Method

Same as the <<mod_locations_put_method,PUT>> method, but only the fields/objects that have to be updated have to be present.
Other fields/objects that are not specified as part of the request are considered unchanged.
Therefore, this method is not suitable to remove information shared earlier.

Any request to the PATCH method SHALL contain the `last_updated` field.

When the PATCH is on a <<mod_locations_connector_object,Connector>> Object,
the Receiver SHALL also set the new `last_updated` value on the parent <<mod_locations_evse_object,EVSE>> and <<mod_locations_location_object,Location>> Objects.

When the PATCH is on a <<mod_locations_evse_object,EVSE>> Object,
the Receiver SHALL also set the new `last_updated` value on the parent <<mod_locations_location_object,Location>> Object.

[[mod_locations_example_a_simple_status_update]]

=== Object description

Location, EVSE and Connector have the following relation.

.Location class diagram
image::images/locations-class-diagram.svg[Location class diagram]

[[mod_locations_location_object]]
==== _Location_ Object

The _Location_ object describes the location and its properties where a group of EVSEs that belong together are installed.
Typically, the _Location_ object is the exact location of the group of EVSEs, but it can also be the entrance of a parking garage which contains these EVSEs.
The exact way to reach each EVSE can be further specified by its own properties.

Locations may be shown in apps or on websites etc. when the flag: `publish` is set to `true`.
Locations that have this flag set to `false` SHALL not be shown in an app or on a website etc. unless
it is to the owner of a <<mod_tokens_token_object,Token>> in the `publish_allowed_to` list.
Even parties like NSP or eMSP that do not 'own' this Token MAY show this location on an app or website,
but only to the owner of that Token.
If the user of their app/website has provided information about his/her <<mod_tokens_token_object,Token>>,
And that information matches all the fields of one of the <<mod_locations_publish_token_class,PublishToken>> tokens in the list,
then they are allowed to show this location to their user.
It is not allowed in OCPI to use a Token that is not 'owned' by the eMSP itself to start a charging session.

===== Example destination charging location

This is an example of a destination charging location.
This is a Location where only guests, employees or customers can charge.
For an EV driver, it can be useful to know if he/she can charge at his destination.

For example at a restaurant, only customers of the restaurant can charge their EV.
Or at an office building where employees and guest of the office can charge their EV.

Locations you can think of where this is useful:
restaurants, bars, clubs, theme parks, stores, supermarkets, company building, office buildings, etc.

[[mod_locations_example_uc3]]
===== Example destination charging location not published, but payed guest usage possible

This is an example of a destination charging location.
But the owner of the location has requested not to publish the location in Apps or on websites.

Charging is still possible: EV drivers of an eMSP with a roaming agreement can still charge their EV.
The eMSP helpdesk can use the information from the Location module to help the driver, maybe even start a session for a driver.
Starting a session from an App is not possible, because the driver will not be able to select the Charge Point on a map.

In case the EV driver is not billed for charging, there is, in such a case, no reason to publish the location via OCPI.

- `publish` = `false`
- `publish_allowed_to` not used
- `parking_type` = not used`
- `EVSE.parking_restrictions` = `CUSTOMERS` May still be useful so a support desk can also tell this to a customer.

===== Example charging location with limited visibility

This is an example of a charging location that only a limit group can see (and use) via an App or website.

Typical examples where this is useful:

- Charge Points in the parking garage of an apartment building. Only owners can see/control the Charge Points.
- Charge Points at an office, for employees only. Only employees can see/control the Charge Points.
- Charge Points at vehicle depot. Any employee can see/control an charge point, even transaction they did not start. Use `group_id` for this.

The locations SHALL NOT be published to the general public.
Only selected <<mod_tokens_token_object,Tokens>> can see (and control) the Charge Points via eMSP app.

- `publish` = `false`
- `publish_allowed_to` contains list with information of <<mod_tokens_token_object,Tokens>> that are allowed to be shown the `Location`.

[[mod_locations_evse_object]]
==== _EVSE_ Object

The _EVSE_ object describes the part that controls the power supply to a single EV in a single session.
It always belongs to a <<mod_locations_location_object,Location>> object. 
The object only contains directions to get from the location itself
to the EVSE (i.e. _floor_, _physical_reference_ or _directions_).

When the directional properties of an EVSE are insufficient to reach the EVSE from the _Location_ point,
then it typically indicates that the EVSE should be put in a different _Location_ object
(sometimes with the same address but with different coordinates/directions).

An _EVSE_ object has a list of Connectors which can not be used simultaneously: only one connector per EVSE can be used at the time.

[cols="7,5,2,18",options="header"]

|Property |Type |Card. |Description 

|uid |<<types_cistring_type,CiString>>(36) |1 |Uniquely identifies the EVSE within the CPOs platform (and suboperator platforms). For example a database ID or the actual "EVSE ID". This field can never be changed, modified or renamed. This is the 'technical' identification of the EVSE, not to be used as 'human readable' identification, use the field `evse_id` for that. +
This field is named `uid` instead of `id`, because `id` could be confused with `evse_id` which is an eMI3 defined field.
|evse_id |<<types_cistring_type,CiString>>(48) |? |Compliant with the following specification for EVSE ID from "eMI3 standard version V1.0" (http://emi3group.com/documents-links/[http://emi3group.com/documents-links/]) "Part 2: business objects."

|===

NOTE: OCPP 1.x does not have good support for Charge Points that have multiple connectors per EVSE.
To make `StartSession` over OCPI work, the CPO SHOULD present the different connectors of an EVSE as separate EVSE,
as is also written by the OCA in the application note: "Multiple Connectors per EVSE in a OCPP 1.x implementation".


[[mod_locations_connector_object]]
==== _Connector_ Object

A _Connector_ is the _socket_ or _cable and plug_ available for the EV to use. 
A single EVSE may provide multiple Connectors but only one of them can be in use at the same time.
A Connector always belongs to an <<mod_locations_evse_object,EVSE>> object.

[[mod_sessions_sessions_module]]
== _Sessions_ module

*Module Identifier: `sessions`*

*Data owner: `CPO`*

*Type:* Functional Module

The Session object describes one charging session.
The Session object is owned by the CPO back-end system, and can be GET from the CPO system, or pushed by the CPO to another system.

[[mod_sessions_flow_and_lifecycle]]
=== Flow and Lifecycle

[[mod_sessions_push_model]]
==== Push model

When the CPO creates a Session object they push it to the corresponding eMSP by calling <<mod_sessions_msp_put_method,PUT>> on the eMSP's Sessions endpoint with the newly created Session object.

Any changes to a Session in the CPO system are sent to the eMSP system by calling <<mod_sessions_patch_method,PATCH>> on the eMSP's Sessions endpoint with the updated Session object.

Sessions cannot be deleted, final status of a session is: `COMPLETED`.

When the CPO is not sure about the state or existence of a Session object in the eMSP's system, the CPO can call <<mod_sessions_msp_get_method,GET>> on the eMSP's Sessions endpoint to validate the Session object in the eMSP's system.

[[mod_sessions_pull_model]]
==== Pull model

eMSPs who do not support the Push model need to call <<mod_sessions_cpo_get_method,GET>> on the CPO's Sessions endpoint to receive a list of Sessions.

This <<mod_sessions_cpo_get_method,GET>> method can also be used in combination with the Push model to retrieve Sessions after the system (re-)connects to a CPO, to get a list Sessions _missed_ during a downtime of the eMSP's system.


[[mod_sessions_set_charging_preferences]]
==== Set: Charging Preferences

For a lot of smart charging use cases, input from the driver is needed.
The smart charging algorithms need to be able to give certain session priority over others.
In other words they need to know how much energy an EV needs before what time.
Via a <<mod_sessions_cpo_put_method,PUT>> request on the Sender Interface, during an ongoing session,
the eMSP can send <<mod_sessions_charging_preferences_object,Charging Preferences>> on behalf of the driver.

The eMSP can determine if an EVSE supports Charging Preferences by checking if the
<<mod_locations_evse_object,EVSE capabilities>> contains:
<<mod_locations_capability_enum,CHARGING_PREFERENCES_CAPABLE>>.

Via <<mod_tariffs_tariff_object,Tariffs>> the CPO can give different Charging Preferences different prices.
A <<mod_locations_connector_object,Connector>> can have multiple <<mod_tariffs_tariff_object,Tariffs>>,
one for each <<mod_sessions_profile_type_enum,ProfileType>>.


[[mod_sessions_reservation]]
==== Reservation

When a EV driver makes a Reservation for a Charge Point/EVSE, the Sender SHALL create a new Session object with `status` = `RESERVED`
When the Push model is used, the CPO SHALL push the new Session object to the Receiver.

When a reservation results in a charging session for the same `Token`, the Session object `status` to: `ACTIVE`

When a reservation does not result in a charging session, the Session object `status` SHALL be set to: `COMPLETED`.

A CDR might be created even if no energy was transferred to the EV, just for the costs of the reservation.

[[mod_sessions_object_description]]
=== Object description

[[mod_sessions_session_object]]
==== _Session_ Object

The Session object describes one charging session. That doesn't mean it is required that energy has been transferred between EV and the Charge Point.
It is possible that the EV never took energy from the Charge Point because it was instructed not to take energy by the driver.
But as the EV was connected to the Charge Point, some form of start tariff, park tariff or reservation cost might be relevant.

NOTE: Although OCPI supports such pricing mechanisms, local laws might not allow this.

It is recommended to add enough `ChargingPeriods` to a Session so that the eMSP is able to provide feedback to the EV driver
about the progress of the charging session.
The ideal amount of transmitted Charging Periods depends on the charging speed.
The Charging Periods should be sufficient for useful feedback but they should not generate too much unneeded traffic either.
How many Charging Periods are transmitted is left to the CPO to decide. The following are just some points to consider:

- Adding a new Charging Period every minute for an AC charging session can be too much as it will yield 180 Charging Periods for an (assumed to be) average 3h session.
- A new Charging Period every 30 minutes for a DC fast charging session is not enough as it will yield only one Charging Period for an (assumed to be) average 30min session.

It is also recommended to add Charging Periods for all moments that are relevant for the Tariff changes,
see <<mod_cdrs_cdr_object,CDR description>> for more information.

:numbered:
[[mod_cdrs_cdrs_module]]
== _CDRs_ module

*Module Identifier: `cdrs`*

*Data owner: `CPO`*

*Type:* Functional Module

A *Charge Detail Record* is the description of a concluded charging session. The CDR is the only billing-relevant object.
CDRs are sent from the CPO to the eMSP after the charging session has ended.
Although there is no requirement to send CDRs in (semi-)realtime, it is seen as good practice to send them as soon as possible.
But if there is an agreement between parties to send them, for example, once a month, that is also allowed by OCPI.

[[mod_cdrs_flow_and_lifecycle]]
=== Flow and Lifecycle

CDRs are created by the CPO. They most likely will be sent only to the eMSP that needs to pay the bill of the underlying charging session.
Because a CDR is for billing purposes, it cannot be changed or replaced once sent to the eMSP. Changes are simply not allowed.
Instead, a <<mod_cdrs_credit_cdrs,Credit CDR>> can be sent.

CDRs may be send for charging locations that have not been published via the <<mod_locations_locations_module,Location>> module.
This is typically for home chargers.


[[mod_cdrs_credit_cdrs]]
==== Credit CDRs

As CDRs are used for billing and can be seen as a kind of invoice, they cannot be deleted. Instead, they have to be credited.

When a CPO wants to make changes to a CDR that was already sent to the eMSP, the CPO has to send a Credit CDR for the first CDR.
This credit CDR SHALL have a different CDR.id which can be a completely different number,
or it can be the id of the original CDR with something appended like for example: `-C` to make it unique again.
To indicate that a CDR is a Credit CDR, the <<mod_cdrs_cdr_object,`credit`>> field has to be set to `true`.
The Credit CDR references the old CDR via the <<mod_cdrs_cdr_object,`credit_reference_id`>> field,
which SHALL contain the <<mod_cdrs_cdr_object,`id`>> of the original CDR.
The Credit CDR will contain all the data of the original CDR.
Only the values in the <<mod_cdrs_cdr_object,`total_cost`>> field SHALL contain the negative amounts of the original CDR.

After having sent the Credit CDR, the CPO can send a new CDR with a new unique ID
and the fields: <<mod_cdrs_cdr_object,`credit`>> and <<mod_cdrs_cdr_object,`credit_reference_id`>> omitted.

NOTE: How far back in time a CPO can send a Credit CDR is not defined by OCPI.
It is up the business contracts between the different parties involved, as there might be local laws involved etc.


[[mod_cdrs_push_model]]
==== Push model

When the CPO creates CDR(s) they push them to the relevant eMSP by calling <<mod_cdrs_post_method,POST>> on the eMSPs CDRs endpoint with the newly created CDR(s). A CPO is not required to send _all_ CDRs to _all_ eMSPs, it is allowed to only send CDRs to the eMSP that a CDR is relevant to.

CDRs should contain enough information (dimensions) to allow the eMSP to validate the total cost.
It is advised to send enough information to the eMSP so that they can calculate their own costs for billing their customers.
An eMSP might have a very different contract/pricing model with their EV drivers than the tariff structure of the CPO.

If the CPO, for any reason, wants to view a CDR it has posted to an eMSP's system, the CPO can retrieve the CDR by performing a <<mod_cdrs_msp_get_method,GET>> request on the eMSP's CDRs endpoint at the URL returned in the response to the <<mod_cdrs_post_method,POST>>.

[[mod_cdrs_pull_model]]
==== Pull model

eMSPs who do not support the Push model need to call
<<mod_cdrs_cpo_get_method,GET>> on the CPO's CDRs endpoint to receive a list of CDRs.

This <<mod_cdrs_cpo_get_method,GET>> can also be used in combination with the Push model to retrieve CDRs after the system (re-)connects to a CPO, to get a list of CDRs _missed_ during a downtime of the eMSP's system.

A CPO is not required to return all known CDRs, the CPO is allowed to return only the CDRs that are relevant for the requesting eMSP.

[[mod_cdrs_interfaces_and_endpoints]]
=== Interfaces and Endpoints

There are both, a Sender and a Receiver interface for CDRs. Depending on business requirements, parties can decide to use
the Sender Interface (Pull model), or the Receiver Interface (Push model), or both.
Push is the preferred model to use, because the Receiver will receive CDRs in semi-realtime when they are created by the CPO.

[[mod_cdrs_cpo_interface]]
==== Sender Interface

Typically implemented by market roles like: CPO.

The CDRs endpoint can be used retrieve CDRs.

[[mod_cdrs_object_description]]
=== Object description

[[mod_cdrs_cdr_object]]
==== _CDR_ Object

The _CDR_ object describes the charging session and its costs, how these costs are composed, etc.

The CDR object is different from the <<mod_sessions_session_object,Session>> object.
The <<mod_sessions_session_object,Session>> object is dynamic as it reflects the current state of the charging session.
The information is meant to be viewed by the driver while the charging session is ongoing.

The CDR on the other hand can be thought of as _sealed_,
preserving the information valid at the moment in time the underlying session was started.
This is a requirement of the main use case for CDRs, namely invoicing.
If e.g. a street is renamed the day after a session took place, the driver should be presented with the name valid at the time the session was started.
This guarantees that the CDR will be recognized as correct by the driver and is not going to be contested.

The _CDR_ object shall always contain information like Location, EVSE, Tariffs and Token as they were *at the start* of the charging session.

A CPO SHALL at least start (and add) a `ChargingPeriod` every moment/event that has relevance for the total costs of a CDR.
During a charging session, different parameters change all the time, like the amount of energy used, or the time of day.
These changes can result in another Tariff Element of the Tariff becoming active.
When another Tariff Element becomes active,
the CPO SHALL add a new Charging Period with at least all the relevant information for the change to the other Tariff Element.
The CPO is allowed to add more _in-between_ Charging Periods to a CDR though. Examples of additional Charging Periods:

- When an energy based Tariff changes in price after 17:00. The CPO SHALL start a new Charging Period at 17:00,
which contains at least the energy in kWh consumed until 17:00.
- When the price of a Tariff is higher when the EV is charging faster than 32A,
a new Charging Period SHALL be added the moment the charging power goes over 32A.
This may be a moment that is calculated by the CPO, as the Charge Point might not send the information to the CPO,
but it can be interpolated by the CPO using the metering information before and after that moment.

|last_updated |<<types_datetime_type,DateTime>> |1 |Timestamp when this CDR was last updated (or created).
|===

NOTE: The actual charging duration (energy being transferred between EVSE and EV) of a charging session can be calculated: `total_charging_time = total_time - total_parking_time`. 

NOTE: Having both a `credit` and a `credit_reference_id` might seem redundant.
But it is seen as an advantage as a boolean flag used in queries is much faster than simple string comparison of references.

NOTE: Different `authorization_reference` values might happen when for example a <<mod_commands_reservenow_object,ReserveNow>>  had a different
`authorization_reference` then the value returned by a <<mod_tokens_real-time_authorization,real-time authorization>>.

|===

NOTE: OCPI makes it possible to provide SoC in the Session object.
This information can be useful to show the current State of Charge to an EV driver during charging.
Implementers should be aware that SoC is only available at some DC Chargers.
Which is currently a small amount of the total amount of Charge Points.
Of these DC Chargers, only a small percentage currently provides SoC via OCPP to the CPO.
Then there is also the question if SoC is allowed to be provided to third-parties as it can be seen as privacy-sensitive information.
So if an implementer wants to show SoC in, for example an App, care should be taken,
to make the App work without SoC, as this will probably not always be available.

[[mod_tariffs_tariffs_module]]
== _Tariffs_ module

*Module Identifier: `tariffs`*

*Data owner: `CPO`*

*Type:* Functional Module

The Tariffs module gives eMSPs information about the tariffs used by the CPO.

[[mod_tariffs_flow_and_lifecycle]]
=== Flow and Lifecycle

[[mod_tariffs_push_model]]
==== Push model

When the CPO creates a new Tariff they push them to the eMSPs by calling the <<mod_tariffs_put_method,PUT>> method on the eMSPs
Tariffs endpoint with the newly created Tariff object.

Any changes to the Tariff(s) in the CPO's system can be sent to the eMSPs systems by calling the <<mod_tariffs_put_method,PUT>>
method on the eMSPs Tariffs endpoint with the updated Tariff object.

When the CPO deletes a Tariff, they will update the eMSPs systems by calling <<mod_tariffs_delete_method,DELETE>>
on the eMSPs Tariffs endpoint with the ID of the Tariff that was deleted.

When the CPO is not sure about the state or existence of a Tariff object in the system of an eMSP, the
CPO can use a <<mod_tariffs_msp_get_method,GET>> request to validate the Tariff object in the eMSP's system. 

[[mod_tariffs_pull_model]]
==== Pull model

eMSPs who do not support the Push model need to call
<<mod_tariffs_cpo_get_method,GET>> on the CPO's Tariff endpoint to receive
all Tariffs, replacing the current list of known Tariffs with the newly received list.

[[mod_tariffs_interfaces_and_endpoints]]
=== Interfaces and Endpoints

There is both a Sender and a Receiver interface for Tariffs. Advised is to use the push direction from Sender to Receiver during normal operation.
The Sender interface is meant to be used when the connection between two parties is established to retrieve the current list of Tariffs objects, and when the Receiver is not 100% sure the Tariff cache is still up-to-date.

[[mod_tariffs_cpo_interface]]
==== Sender Interface

Typically implemented by market roles like: CPO.

The Sender's Tariffs interface gives the Receiver the ability to request Tariffs information.

[[mod_tariffs_emsp_interface]]
==== Receiver Interface

Typically implemented by market roles like: eMSP and NSP.

Tariffs are <<transport_and_format_client_owned_object_push,Client Owned Objects>>, so the endpoints need to contain the required extra fields: {<<credentials_credentials_object,party_id>>} and {<<credentials_credentials_object,country_code>>}.

Endpoint structure definition:

`{tariffs_endpoint_url}/{country_code}/{party_id}/{tariff_id}`

Example:

`+https://www.server.com/ocpi/cpo/2.2/tariffs/BE/BEC/12+`

|Method |Description 

|<<mod_tariffs_msp_get_method,GET>> |Retrieve a Tariff as it is stored in the eMSP's system. 
|POST |n/a 
|<<mod_tariffs_put_method,PUT>> |Push new/updated Tariff object to the eMSP. 
|PATCH|n/a
|<<mod_tariffs_delete_method,DELETE>> |Remove a Tariff object which is no longer in use and will not be used in future either. 
|===

[[mod_tariffs_msp_get_method]]
===== *GET* Method

If the CPO wants to check the status of a Tariff in the eMSP's system, it might GET the object from the eMSP's system for validation purposes.
After all, the CPO is the owner of the object, so it would be illogical if the eMSP's system had a different status or was missing the object entirely.

[[mod_tariffs_object_description]]
=== Object description

[[mod_tariffs_tariff_object]]
==== _Tariff_ Object

A Tariff object consists of a list of one or more Tariff Elements, which can be used to create complex Tariff structures.

When the list of Tariff Elements contains more than one Element with the same Tariff Dimension (ENERGY/FLAT/TIME etc.),
than the first Tariff Element with that Dimension in the list with matching Tariff Restrictions will be used.
Only one Tariff per Element type can be active at any point in time, but multiple Tariff Types can be active at once.
IE you can have an `ENERGY` element and `TIME` element active at the same time, but only the first valid element of each.

When no Tariff Element with a specific Dimension is found for which the Restrictions match,
and there is no Tariff Element in the list with the given Dimension without Restrictions,
there will be no costs for that Tariff Dimension.

It is advised to always add a "default" Tariff Element per Dimension (ENERGY/FLAT/TIME etc.).
This can be achieved by adding a Tariff Element without Restrictions after all other occurrences of the same Dimension
in the list of Tariff Elements (the order is important).
Such a Tariff Element will act as fallback when no other Tariff Element of a specific Dimension matches the relevant parameters (Restrictions).

To define a "Free of Charge" tariff in OCPI, a Tariff with `type` = `FLAT` and `price` = `0.00` has to be provided.
See: <<mod_tariffs_free_of_charge_tariff_example,Free of Charge Tariff example>>

      This is different from a `FLAT` fee (Start Tariff, Transaction Fee), as a `FLAT` fee is a fixed amount that has to be payed for any Charging Session.
      A minimum price indicates that when the cost of a Charging Session is lower than this amount, the cost of the Session will be equal to this amount. (Also see note below)

|===

NOTE: `min_price`: As the VAT might be built up of different parts, there might be situations where minimum cost including VAT is reached earlier or later than the minimum cost excluding VAT.
So as a rule, they both apply:
 - The total cost of a Charging Session excluding VAT can never be lower than the `min_price` excluding VAT.
 - The total cost of a Charging Session including VAT can never be lower than the `min_price` including VAT.

NOTE: `max_price`: As the VAT might be built up of different parts, there might be situations where maximum cost including VAT is reached earlier or later than the maximum cost excluding VAT.
So as a rule, they both apply:
 - The total cost of a Charging Session excluding VAT can never be higher than the `max_price` excluding VAT.
 - The total cost of a Charging Session including VAT can never be higher than the `max_price` including VAT.

NOTE: `start_date_time` and `end_date_time`: When the Tariff of a Charge Point (Location) is changed during an ongoing charging session,
it is common to not switch the Tariff until the ongoing session is finished. But this is NOT a rule of OCPI.
When charging at a Charge Point, a driver accepts the tariff which is valid when they start their charging session.
If the Tariff of the Charge Point would change during the charging session,
the driver might get billed something they didn't agree to when starting the session.

NOTE: The fields: `tariff_alt_text` and `tariff_alt_url` may be used separately,
or in combination with each other or even combined with the structured tariff `elements`.
When a Tariff contains both the `tariff_alt_text` and `elements` fields,
the `tariff_alt_text` SHALL only contain additional tariff information in human-readable text,
not the price information that is also available via the `elements` field.
Reason for this: the eMSP might have additional fees they want to include in communication with their customer.


[[mod_tariffs_examples]]
===== Examples

In the following section, a few different pricing strategies will be explained with some Tariff examples.
For simplicity, we will use euro as currency in all of the examples if not mentioned otherwise.

[[mod_tariffs_simple_tariff_example_0_25_euro_per_kwh]]
====== Simple Tariff example 0.25 euro per kWh

* Energy
[disc]
** 0.25 euro per kWh (excl. VAT)
** 10% VAT
** Billed per 1 Wh

This tariff will result in costs of 5.00 euro (excl. VAT) or 5.50 euro (incl. VAT) when 20 kWh are charged.

[source,json]
----
include::examples/tariff_8_simple_025kwh.json[]

[[mod_tariffs_tariff_example_0_25_euro_per_kwh_start]]
====== Tariff example 0.25 euro per kWh + start fee

* Start or transaction fee
[disc]
** 0.50 euro (excl. VAT)
** 20% VAT
* Energy
[disc]
** 0.25 euro per kWh (excl. VAT)
** 10% VAT
** Billed per 1 Wh

This tariff will result in total cost of 5.50 euro (excl. VAT) or 6.10 euro (incl. VAT) when 20 kWh are charged.

[source,json]
----
include::examples/tariff_9_025kwh_start.json[]
----


[[mod_tariffs_tariff_example_0_25_euro_per_kwh_min_price]]
====== Tariff example 0.25 euro per kWh + minimum price

* Minimum price
** 0.50 euro (excl. VAT)
** 0.55 euro (incl. VAT, which is 10%)
* Energy
[disc]
** 0.25 euro per kWh (excl. VAT)
** 10% VAT
** Billed per 1 Wh

This tariff will result in costs of 5.00 euro (excl. VAT) or 5.50 euro (incl. VAT) when 20 kWh are charged.
But if less than 2 kWh is charged, 0.50 euro (excl. VAT) or 0.55 euro (incl. VAT) will be billed.

This is different from a start fee as can be seen when compared to the example above.

[source,json]

include::examples/tariff_12_025kwh_min_price.json[]
----


[[mod_tariffs_tariff_example_0_25_euro_per_kwh_parking_start]]
====== Tariff example 0.25 euro per kWh + parking fee + start fee

* Start or transaction fee
[disc]
** 0.50 euro (excl. VAT)
** 20% VAT
* Energy
[disc]
** 0.25 euro per kWh (excl. VAT)
** 10% VAT
** Billed per 1 Wh
* Parking
[disc]
** 2.00 euro per hour (excl. VAT)
** 20% VAT
** Billed per 15 min (900 seconds)

For a charging session where 20 kWh are charged and the vehicle is parked for 40 minutes after the session ended,
this tariff will result in costs of 7.00 euro (excl. VAT) or 7.90 euro (incl. VAT).
Because the parking time is billed per 15 minutes, the driver has to pay for 45 minutes of parking even though
they left 40 minutes after their vehicle stopped charging.

[[mod_tariffs_tariff_example_0_25_euro_per_kwh_start_max_price]]
====== Tariff example 0.25 euro per kWh + start fee + max price + tariff end date

* Maximum price
[disc]
** 10 euro (excl. VAT)
** 11 euro (incl. VAT, which is 10%)
* Start or transaction fee
[disc]
** 0.50 euro (excl. VAT)
** 20% VAT
* Energy
[disc]
** 0.25 euro per kWh (excl. VAT)
** 10% VAT
** Billed per 1 Wh

This tariff has an end date: 30 June 2019, which is typically used when a tariff is going to be replaced by a new tariff.
A <<mod_locations_connector_object,Connector>> of a <<mod_locations_location_object,Location>> can have multiple Tariffs (IDs) assigned.
By assigning both, the old and the new tariff ID, they will automatically be replaced.
It is not required to update all Locations at the same time, the old tariff can also be removed later.

For a charging session where 50 kWh are charged,
this tariff will result in costs of 10.00 euro (excl. VAT) or 11.00 euro (incl. VAT) due to the price limit.
If only 30 kWh were charged, the costs would be 8.00 euro (excl. VAT) and 8.85 euro (incl. VAT),
as the start fee combined with the energy costs would be lower than the defined max price.

[[mod_tariffs_simple_tariff_example_2_euro_per_hour]]
====== Simple Tariff example 2 euro per hour

An example of a tariff where the driver does not pay per kWh, but for the time of using the Charge Point.

* Charging Time
[disc]
** 2.00 euro per hour (excl. VAT)
** 10% VAT
** Billed per 1 min (60 seconds)

As this is tariff only has a `TIME` price_component, the driver will not be billed for time they are not charging: `PARKING_TIME`

For a charging session of 2.5 hours,
this tariff will result in costs of 5.00 euro (excl. VAT) or 5.50 euro (incl. VAT).

[[mod_tariffs_simple_tariff_example_3_euro_per_hour_5_euro_parking]]
====== Simple Tariff example 3 euro per hour, 5 euro per hour parking

Example of a tariff where the driver pays for the time of using the Charge Point, but pays more when the car is no longer charging,
to discourage the EV driver of leaving his EV connected when it is already full.

* Charging Time
[disc]
** 3.00 euro per hour (excl. VAT)
** 10% VAT
** Billed per 1 min (60 seconds)
* Parking
[disc]
** 5.00 euro per hour (excl. VAT)
** 20% VAT
** Billed per 5 min (300 seconds)

For a charging session of 2.5 hours where the vehicle is parked for 42 more minutes after charging ended,
resulting in a total session time of 150 minutes (charging) + 42 minutes (parking),
this tariff will result in costs of 11.25 euro (excl. VAT) or 12.75 euro (incl. VAT).
Because the parking time is billed per 5 minutes, the driver has to pay for 45 minutes of parking even though
they left 42 minutes after their vehicle stopped charging.

[[mod_tariffs_simple_tariff_example_with_alternative_multi_language_text]]
====== Ad-Hoc simple Tariff example with multiple languages

For ad-hoc charging (paying for charging without a contract), the tariff `elements` are less needed.
The eMSP is not involved when a driver uses ad-hoc payment at the Charge Point, so no CDR is send to an eMSP.
Having a good human readable text is much more useful.

* Charging Time
[disc]
** 1.9 euro per hour (excl. VAT)
** 5.2% VAT
** Billed per 5 minutes (300 seconds)

For a charging session of 2.5 hours,
this tariff will result in costs of 4.75 euro (excl. VAT) or 5.00 euro (incl. VAT).

[[mod_tariffs_adhoc_tariff_example_not_possible_with_ocpi]]
====== Ad-Hoc Tariff example not possible with OCPI

For this example, the credit card start tariff is 0.50 euro, but when using a debit card it is only 0.25 euro.

Such a tariff cannot be modeled with OCPI. +
But by modeling it as 0.50 euro start tariff where debit card users are given a discount in the final CDR of 0.25 euro, nobody is likely to complain.
The `tariff_alt_text` explains this clearly.

[source,json]
----
include::examples/tariff_11_not_possible_alt_text.json[]
----


[[mod_tariffs_simple_tariff_example_with_alternative_url]]
====== Simple Tariff example with alternative URL

This examples shows the use of `tariff_alt_url`.

This examples shows a `PROFILE_CHEAP` tariff, which is a smart charging tariff.
Drivers are able to select this tariff by setting the `profile_type` in their
<<mod_sessions_set_charging_preferences,Charging Preferences>> to `CHEAP`.
In such case, the price might not be fixed, but depend on the real-time energy prices.
To explain this to the driver, a short text inside `tariff_alt_text` might not be the best solution.
Showing a graph could be better.
Therefore it is also possible to provide an URL in `tariff_alt_url` to a site that explains
the tariff better and in more detail.

* Energy
[disc]
** 0.25 euro per kWh (excl. VAT)
** 10% VAT
** Billed per 0.1 kWh (100 Wh)

For a charging session where 20.45 kWh are charged,
this tariff will result in costs of 5.50 euro (excl. VAT) or 6.05 euro (incl. VAT)
if the announced prices were billed.
Because the energy is billed per 0.1 kWh, the driver has to pay for 20.5 kWh even though
they only charged 20.45 kWh.

The twist here is that this tariff makes use of `tariff_alt_url` which links to a page
with real-time energy prices of the operator, where is shown that the actual price per kWh is different.
With an assumed current energy price of 0.22 euro per kWh (excl. VAT), which is shown or explained on
the page linked by `tariff_alt_url`, the resulting costs will be 4.51 euro (excl. VAT) or 4.96 euro (incl. VAT).

For a charging session on a Monday morning starting at 09:30 which takes 2.45 hours,
where the driver uses a maximum of 16A of power and is parking for additional 42 minutes afterwards,
this tariff will result in costs of 8.75 euro (excl. VAT) or 10 euro (incl. VAT)
for a total session time of 147 minutes (charging) + 42 minutes (parking).
Because charging is billed per 15 minutes, the driver has to pay for 150 minutes.
Similarly, the driver has to pay for 45 minutes of parking as its billed per 5 minutes.

For a charging session on a Saturday afternoon starting at 13:30 which takes 1.9 hours,
where the driver uses a minimum of 43A of power and is parking for additional 71 minutes afterwards,
this tariff will result in costs of 12.50 euro (excl. VAT) or 14,13 euro (incl. VAT)
for a total session time of 114 minutes (charging) + 71 minutes (parking).
Because charging is billed per 10 minutes, the driver has to pay for 120 minutes.
Similarly, the driver has to pay for 75 minutes of parking as its billed per 5 minutes.

[[mod_tariffs_free_of_charge_tariff_example]]
====== Free of Charge Tariff example
In this example no VAT is given because it is not necessary (as the `price` is `0.00`).
This might not always be the case though and it is of course permitted to add a VAT,
even if the `price` is set to zero.

[[mod_tariffs_first_hour_free_energy]]
====== First hour free energy example

In this example, we have the following scenario:

* The first hour of parking time is free.
* From the second to the fourth hour, parking costs 2.00 euro per hour
* From the fourth hour on, parking costs 3.00 euro per hour.
* The first kWh of energy is free, every additional kWh costs 0.20 euro.

Translated into our tariff schema, the pricing model looks like this:

* Energy
[disc]
** First kWh: free
** Any additional energy
[disc]
*** 0.20 euro per kWh (excl. VAT)
*** Billed per 1 Wh
* Parking
[disc]
** First hour of parking: free
** Second to fourth hours of parking
[disc]
*** 2.00 euro per hour (excl. VAT)
*** Billed per 1 min (60 seconds)
** Any parking after four hours
[disc]
*** 3.00 euro per hour (excl. VAT)
*** Billed per 1 min (60 seconds)

For a charging session where the driver charges 20 kWh and where the vehicle is parked for 2.75 more hours after charging ended,
this tariff will result in costs of 7.30 euro (excl. VAT).
As no VAT information is given, it is not possible to calculate total costs including VAT.

For a charging session that was started 13 minutes after the reservation time, where the driver charges 20 kWh,
this tariff will result in costs of 8.75 euro (excl. VAT) or 10.00 euro (incl. VAT).
Because the reservation fee is billed per 5 minutes, the driver has to pay for 15 minutes of reservation even though
they started the charging session 13 minutes after the reservation time.

* Reservation
[disc]
** 4.00 euro reservation expiration fee (excl. VAT) (_billed when a reservation expires and is not followed by a charging session_)
** 2.00 euro per hour (excl. VAT)
** 20% VAT
** Billed per 10 min (600 seconds)

This example is very similar to <<mod_tariffs_tariff_example_15_reservation_5_euro_per_hour,Tariff example with reservation price>>
with the difference that expired reservations cost something and that reservation time is billed per 10 minutes.
Also, the price for reservation is different.

For a charging session that was started 22 minutes after the reservation time, where the driver charges 20 kWh,
this tariff will result in costs of 6.50 euro (excl. VAT) or 7.30 euro (incl. VAT).
Because the reservation fee is billed per 10 minutes, the driver has to pay for 30 minutes of reservation even though
they started the charging session 22 minutes after the reservation time.

If the driver did not start a charging session and the reservation expired after the reserved time of 1 hour,
the tariff would have resulted in costs of 6.00 euro (excl. VAT) or 7.20 euro (incl. VAT).
In case a reservation is not used, the driver has to pay the full amount of reserved time
as well as an additional expiration fee as compensation for not charging at all.

====== Tariff example with reservation time and expire time

* Reservation
[disc]
** 3.00 euro per hour (excl. VAT)
** 6.00 euro per hour (excl. VAT) (_billed when a reservation expires and is not followed by a charging session_)
** 20% VAT
** Billed per 10 min (600 seconds)
* Start or transaction fee
[disc]
** 0.50 euro (excl. VAT)
** 20% VAT
* Energy
[disc]
** 0.25 euro per kWh (excl. VAT)
** 10% VAT
** Billed per 1 Wh

This example is very similar to <<mod_tariffs_tariff_example_15_reservation_5_euro_per_hour,Tariff example with reservation price>>
with the difference that expired reservations cost something and that reservation time is billed per 10 minutes.
Also, the price for reservation is different.

For a charging session that was started 22 minutes after the reservation time, where the driver charges 20 kWh,
this tariff will result in costs of 7.00 euro (excl. VAT) or 7.90 euro (incl. VAT).
Because the reservation fee is billed per 10 minutes, the driver has to pay for 30 minutes of reservation even though
they started the charging session 22 minutes after the reservation time.

If the driver did not start a charging session and the reservation expired after the reserved time of 1.5 hours,
the tariff would have resulted in costs of 9.00 euro (excl. VAT) or 10.80 euro (incl. VAT).
In case a reservation is not used, the driver has to pay the expiration fee as compensation for not charging at all.

|Property |Type |Card. |Description 

|type |<<mod_tariffs_tariffdimensiontype_enum,TariffDimensionType>> |1 |Type of tariff dimension.
|price |<<types_number_type,number>> |1 |Price per unit (excl. VAT) for this tariff dimension.
|vat |<<types_number_type,number>> |? |Applicable VAT percentage for this tariff dimension. If omitted, no VAT is applicable. Not providing a VAT is different from 0% VAT, which would be a value of 0.0 here.
|step_size |int |1 |Minimum amount to be billed. This unit will be billed in this `step_size` blocks. For example: if `type` is `TIME` and `step_size` has a value of `300`, then time will be billed in blocks of 5 minutes. If 6 minutes were used, 10 minutes (2 blocks of `step_size`) will be billed.
|===

NOTE: `step_size`: depends on the `type` and every `type` (except `FLAT`) defines a `step_size` multiplier, which is the size of every _step_ for that `type` in the givgen unit. +
 +
For example: `PARKING_TIME` has the `step_size` multiplier: _1 second_, which means that the `step_size` of a `PriceComponent` is multiplied by _1 second_.
Thus a `step_size = 300` means `300 seconds` (`5 minutes`). This means that when someone parked for 8 minutes they will be billed for 10 minutes.
The parking time will be simply rounded up to the next larger chunk of `step_size` (i.e. blocks of `300 seconds` in this example). +
 +
Another example: `ENERGY` has the `step_size` multiplied: _1 Wh_, which means that the `step_size` of a `PriceComponent` is multiplied by _1 Wh_.
Thus a `step_size = 1` with a `price = 0.25` will result in a cost calculation that uses the charged Wh as precision. +
If someone charges their EV with 115.2 Wh, then they are billed for 116 Wh, resulting in total cost of 0.029 euro. +
When `step_size = 25`, then the same amount would be billed for 101 to 125 Wh: 0.031 euro. +
When `step_size = 500`, then the same amount will be billed for 1 to 500 Wh: 0.125 euro.

NOTE: `step_size` SHALL only be taken into account for the last <<mod_tariffs_tariffelement_class,`TariffElement`>>
and when switching to another <<mod_tariffs_tariffelement_class,`TariffElement`>> for the <<mod_tariffs_pricecomponent_class,`PriceComponents`>>
that is not in the new <<mod_tariffs_tariffelement_class,`TariffElement`>>.
The same rule applies in case there is a switch between 2 Tariffs
(for example when a driver selects a different <<mod_sessions_set_charging_preferences,Charging Preference>> <<mod_sessions_profile_type_enum,`profile_type`>>).


===== Example Tariff
Example Tariff to explain the `step_size` when switching from one <<mod_tariffs_tariffelement_class,`TariffElement`>> to another:

- Charging fee of 1.20 euro per hour (excl. VAT) before 17:00 with a `step_size` of 30 minutes (1800 seconds)
- Charging fee of 2.40 euro per hour (excl. VAT) after 17:00 with a `step_size` of 15 minutes (900 seconds)
- Parking fee of 1.00 euro per hour (excl. VAT) before 20:00 with a `step_size` of 15 minutes (900 seconds)

====== Example: switching to different Tariff Element #1

An EV driver plugs in at 16:55 and charges for 10 minutes (`TIME`).
They then stop charging but stay plugged in for 2 more minutes (`PARKING_TIME`).
The total session time is therefore 12 minutes, resulting in the following costs:

- 5 billable minutes of charging time before 17:00, generating costs of 0.10 euro.
- 10 billable minutes of charging time after 17:00, generating costs of 0.40 euro. As the Price Component of the last Tariff Element being used has a `step_size` of 15 minutes, we bill a total charging duration of 15 minutes. When considering the already billed 5 minutes of charging time before 17:00, we are left with 10 minutes to bill after 17:00.
- 15 billable minutes of parking time, generating costs of 0.25 euro.
- The total for this charging session is therefore *0.75 euro* (excl. VAT).

====== Example: switching to different Tariff Element #2

An EV driver plugs in at 16:35 and charges for 35 minutes (`TIME`).
After that they immediately unplug, leaving with a total session time of 35 minutes and a bill over the following costs:

- 25 billable minutes of charging time before 17:00, generating costs of 0.50 euro.
- 20 billable minutes of charging time after 17:00, generating costs of 0.80 euro. As the Price Component of the last Tariff Element being used has a `step_size` of 15 minutes, we bill a total charging duration of 45 minutes. When considering the already billed 25 minutes of charging time before 17:00, we are left with 20 minutes to bill after 17:00.
- 45 billable minutes of parking time, generating costs of 0.75 euro.
- The total for this charging session is therefore *2.05 euro* (excl. VAT).

====== Example: switching to Free-of-Charge Tariff Element

When parking becomes free after 20:00, the new <<mod_tariffs_tariffelement_class,`TariffElement`>> after 20:00 will not contain a
<<mod_tariffs_tariffdimensiontype_enum,`PARKING_TIME`>> <<mod_tariffs_pricecomponent_class,`PriceComponent`>>.
So the last parking period that needs to be payed, which is before 20:00, will be billed according to the `step_size`
of the <<mod_tariffs_tariffdimensiontype_enum,`PARKING_TIME`>> <<mod_tariffs_pricecomponent_class,`PriceComponent`>> before 20:00.

An EV driver plugs in at 19:55 and charges for 10 minutes (`TIME`).
They then stop charging but stay plugged in for 2 more minutes (`PARKING_TIME`).
The total session time is therefore 12 minutes, resulting in the following costs:

- 5 billable minutes of charging time before 20:00, generating costs of 0.20 euro.
- 10 billable minutes of charging time after 20:00, generating costs of 0.40 euro. As the Price Component of the last Tariff Element being used has a `step_size` of 15 minutes, we bill a total charging duration of 15 minutes. When considering the already billed 5 minutes of charging time before 20:00, we are left with 10 minutes to bill after 20:00.
- 15 billable minutes of parking time, generating costs of 0.25 euro. As the last Price Component with `type = PARKING_TIME` has a `step_size` of 15 minutes, we do round up to the `step_size` of 15 minutes even though only 5 minutes of parking that happened before 20:00.
- The total for this charging session is therefore *0.85 euro* (excl. VAT).

===== Example: Tariff with max_power Tariff Restrictions

Example Tariff to explain the `max_power` Tariff Restriction:

- Charging fee of 1.00 euro per kWh (excl. VAT) when charging with a power of less than 16 kW.
- Charging fee of 1.50 euro per kWh (excl. VAT) when charging with a power between 16 and 32 kW.
- Charging fee of 2.00 euro per kWh (excl. VAT) when charging with a power above 32 kW (implemented as fallback tariff without Restriction).

For a charging session where the EV charges the first kWh with a power of 6 kW,
increases the power to 48 kW for the next 40 kWh and reduces it again to 4 kW after that for another 0.5 kWh
(probably due to physical limitations, i.e. temperature of the battery),
this tariff will result in costs of 20.30 euro (excl. VAT). The costs are composed of the following components:

- 1 kWh at 6 kW: 0.20 euro
- 40 kWh at 48 kW: 20.00 euro
- 0.5 kWh at 4 kW: 0.10 euro

===== Example: Tariff with max_duration Tariff Restrictions

A supermarket wants to allow their customer to charge for free.
As most customers will be out of the store in 20 minutes, they allow free charging for 30 minutes.
If a customer charges longer than that, they will charge them the normal price per kWh.
But as they want to discourage long usage of their Charge Points, charging becomes much more expensive after 1 hour:

- First 30 minutes of charging is free.
- Charging fee of 0.25 euro per kWh (excl. VAT) after 30 minutes.
- Charging fee of 0.40 euro per kWh (excl. VAT) after 60 minutes.

For a charging session with a duration of 40 minutes where 5 kWh are charged during the first 30 minutes
and another 1.2 kWh in the remaining 10 minutes of the session,
this tariff will result in costs of 0.30 euro (excl. VAT). The costs are composed of the following components:

- 5 kWh for free: 0.00 euro
- 1.2 kWh at 0.25/kWh: 0.30 euro

[[mod_tokens_tokens_module]]
== _Tokens_ module

*Module Identifier: `tokens`*

*Data owner: `MSP`*

*Type:* Functional Module

The tokens module gives CPOs knowledge of the token information of an eMSP.
eMSPs can push Token information to CPOs, CPOs can build a cache of known Tokens.
When a request to authorize comes from a Charge Point, the CPO can check against this cache.
With this cached information they know to which eMSP they can later send a CDR. 

[[mod_tokens_flow_and_lifecycle]]
=== Flow and Lifecycle

[[mod_tokens_push_model]]
==== Push model

When the eMSP creates a new Token object they push it to the CPO by calling <<mod_tokens_put_method,PUT>> on the CPO's Tokens endpoint with the newly created Token object.

Any changes to Token in the eMSP system are sent to the CPO system by calling either the <<mod_tokens_put_method,PUT>> or the <<mod_tokens_patch_method,PATCH>> on the CPO's Tokens endpoint with the updated Token(s).

When the eMSP invalidates a Token (deleting is not possible), the eMSP will send the updated Token (with the field: valid set to `false`, by calling, either the <<mod_tokens_put_method,PUT>> or the <<mod_tokens_patch_method,PATCH>> on the CPO's Tokens endpoint with the updated Token. 

When the eMSP is not sure about the state or existence of a Token object in the CPO system, the
eMSP can call the <<mod_tokens_cpo_get_method,GET>> to validate the Token object in the CPO system. 

[[mod_tokens_pull_model]]
==== Pull model

When a CPO is not sure about the state of the list of known Tokens, or wants to request the full
list as a start-up of their system, the CPO can call the <<mod_tokens_msp_get_method,GET>> on the eMSP's Token endpoint to receive
all Tokens, updating already known Tokens and adding new received Tokens to it own list of Tokens.
This is not intended for real-time operation, requesting the full list of tokens for every authorization will put to much strain on systems.
It is intended for getting in-sync with the server, or to get a list of all tokens (from a server without Push mode) every X hours.

[[mod_tokens_real-time_authorization]]
==== Real-time authorization

An eMSP might want their Tokens to be authorized 'real-time', not white-listed.
For this the eMSP has to implement the <<mod_tokens_post_method,POST Authorize request>>
and set the Token.whitelist field to `NEVER` for Tokens they want to have authorized 'real-time'.

If an eMSP doesn't want real-time authorization, the <<mod_tokens_post_method,POST Authorize request>> doesn't
have to be implemented as long as all their Tokens have Token.whitelist set to `ALWAYS`.

When an eMSP does not want to Push the full list of tokens to CPOs,
the CPOs will need to call the <<mod_tokens_post_method,POST Authorize request>> to check if a Token is known by the eMSP, and if it is valid.

NOTE: Doing real-time authorization of RFID will mean a longer delay of the authorization process, which might result in bad user experience at the Charge Point.
So care should be taken to keep delays in processing the request to an absolute minimum.

NOTE: Real-time authorization might be asked for a charging location that is not published via the <<mod_locations_locations_module,Location>> module,
typically a private charger. In most cases this is expected to result in: `ALLOWED`.

NOTE: If real-time authorization is asked for a location, the eMSP SHALL NOT validate that charging is possible based on information like opening hours or EVSE status etc,
this information might not be update to date.


[[mod_tokens_interfaces_and_endpoints]]
=== Interfaces and endpoints

There is both a Sender and a Receiver interface for Tokens. It is advised to use the Push direction from Sender to Receiver during normal operation.
The Sender interface is meant to be used when the Receiver is not 100% sure the Token cache is still correct.

[[mod_tokens_cpo_interface]]
==== Receiver Interface

Typically implemented by market roles like: CPO.

With this interface the Sender can push the Token information to the Receiver.
Tokens is a <<transport_and_format_client_owned_object_push,Client Owned Object>>, so the end-points need to contain the required extra fields: {<<credentials_credentials_object,party_id>>} and {<<credentials_credentials_object,country_code>>}.

Endpoint structure definition:

`{token_endpoint_url}{country_code}/{party_id}/{token_uid}[?type={type}]`

[[mod_tokens_cpo_get_method]]
===== *GET* Method

If the eMSP wants to check the status of a Token in the CPO system it might GET the object from the CPO system for validation purposes. The eMSP is the owner of the objects, so it would be illogical if the CPO system had a different status or was missing an object.

                                      If this is a `APP_USER` or `AD_HOC_USER` Token, it will be a uniquely, by the eMSP, generated ID. +
                                      This field is named `uid` instead of `id` to prevent confusion with: `contract_id`.

|last_updated |<<types_datetime_type,DateTime>> |1 |Timestamp when this Token was last updated (or created).

The combination of _uid_ and _type_ should be unique for every token within the eMSP's system.

NOTE: OCPP supports group_id (or ParentID as it is called in OCPP 1.5/1.6) OCPP 1.5/1.6 only support group ID's with maximum length of string(20), case insensitive.
As long as EV-driver can be expected to charge at an OCPP 1.5/1.6 Charge Point, it is adviced to not used a group_id longer then 20.

|Value |Description 

|AD_HOC_USER |One time use Token ID generated by a server (or App.) The eMSP uses this to bind a Session to a customer, probably an app user.
|APP_USER |Token ID generated by a server (or App.) to identify a user of an App. The same user uses the same Token for every Session.
|OTHER |Other type of token

|===

NOTE: The eMSP is RECOMMENDED to push Tokens with type: `AD_HOC_USER` or `APP_USER` with `whitelist` set to `NEVER`.
Whitelists are very useful for RFID type Tokens, but the `AD_HOC_USER`/`APP_USER` Tokens are used to start Sessions from an App etc. so whitelisting them has no advantages.

Defines when authorization of a Token by the CPO is allowed.

The validity of a Token has no influence on this. If a Token is: `valid = false`,
when the `whitelist` field requires real-time authorization, the CPO SHALL do a <<mod_tokens_real-time_authorization,real-time authorization>>,
the state of the Token might have changed.

[cols="3,10",options="header"]
|===
|Value |Description 

|ALWAYS |Token always has to be whitelisted, <<mod_tokens_real-time_authorization,realtime authorization>> is not possible/allowed. CPO shall always allow any use of this Token.
|ALLOWED |It is allowed to whitelist the token, <<mod_tokens_real-time_authorization,realtime authorization>> is also allowed. The CPO may choose which version of authorization to use.
|ALLOWED_OFFLINE |In normal situations <<mod_tokens_real-time_authorization,realtime authorization>> shall be used. But when the CPO cannot get a response from the eMSP (communication between CPO and eMSP is offline), the CPO shall allow this Token to be used.

[[mod_commands_commands_module]]
== _Commands_ module

*Module Identifier: `commands`*

*Type:* Functional Module

The Commands module enables remote commands to be sent to a Location/EVSE.
The following commands are supported:

- `RESERVE_NOW`
- `CANCEL_RESERVATION`
- `START_SESSION`
- `STOP_SESSION`
- `UNLOCK_CONNECTOR`

See <<mod_commands_commandtype_enum,CommandType>> for a description of the different commands.
_Use the `UNLOCK_CONNECTOR` command with care, please read the note at <<mod_commands_commandtype_enum,CommandType>>._ 

*Module dependency:* <<mod_locations_locations_module,Locations module>>, <<mod_sessions_sessions_module,Sessions module>>

[[mod_commands_flow]]
=== Flow

With the Commands module, commands can be sent from the eMSP, via the CPO to a Charge Point.
Most Charge Point are hooked up to the internet via a relative slow wireless connection. To prevent long blocking calls,
the commands module is designed to work asynchronously.

The Sender (typically eMSP) send a request to a Receiver (typically CPO), via the Receivers Commands interface.
The Receiver checks if it can send the request to a Charge Point and will respond to the request with a status, indicating if the request can be sent to a Charge Point.

The Receiver (typically CPO) sends the requested command (via another protocol, for example: OCPP) to a Charge Point.
The Charge Point will respond if it understands the command and will try to execute the command.
This response doesn't always mean that the command was executed successfully.
The Receiver (typically CPO) will forward the result in a new POST request to the Senders Commands interface.

The following examples try to give insight into the message flow and the asynchronous nature of the OCPI Commands.

Example of a `START_SESSION` that is accepted, but no new Session is started because EV not plugged in before end of time-out.
This is an example for Charge Point that allows a remote start when the cable is not yet plugged in.
Some Charge Points even require this, there might, for example, be a latch in front of the socket to prevent vandalism.

.START_SESSION failed
image::images/command_start_session_timeout.svg[START_SESSION failed]


Example of a `START_SESSION` that is accepted, but no new Session is started because the EV is not plugged in,
and this Charge Point does not allow a remote start without a cable already being plugged in.

.START_SESSION failed
image::images/command_start_session_no_cable.svg[START_SESSION failed]


Example of a `START_SESSION` that is accepted and results in a new Session.

.START_SESSION successful
image::images/command_start_session_succesful.svg[START_SESSION successful]


Example of a `START_SESSION` with a Token that is Whitelist: NEVER.

The CPO does not check the Token in the START_SESSION. If needed, the Charge Point does an OCPP Authorize request.
In case of a Token whitelist NEVER or ALLOWED_OFFLINE, the CPO does an <<mod_tokens_real-time_authorization,realtime authorization>>.

.START_SESSION whitelist NEVER
image::images/command_start_session_whitelist_never.svg[START_SESSION whitelist NEVER]


Example of a `UNLOCK_CONNECTOR` that fails because the Location is not known by the CPO.

.UNLOCK_CONNECTOR Unknown Location
image::images/command_unlock_unknow_location.svg["UNLOCK_CONNECTOR Unknown Location"]


Example of a `RESERVE_NOW` that is rejected by the Charge Point.

.RESERVE_NOW rejected by Charge Point
image::images/command_reservenow_rejected.svg[RESERVE_NEW rejected by Charge Point]

Example of a successful `RESERVE_NOW`.

.Successful RESERVE_NOW
image::images/command_reservenow_successful.svg[Successful RESERVE_NOW]


Reservation canceled by the CPO. +
OCPI makes it possible for a CPO to cancel a reservation.
This is not to be taken lightly. When a driver makes a reservation of a Charge Point/EVSE, he/she wants to be sure to have a charging location.
So if the CPO cancel the reservation, the driver will for sure not like it.
But there are some circumstances where the CPO is forced to cancel a reservation.
For example: Charge Point has become defect, or the CPO is notified of ongoing roadworks which makes the Charge Point unreachable etc.

To Cancel a reservation the CPO call the Senders interface with the same URL as was given by the Sender (eMSP) when the `RESERVE_NOW` command was send.

The sequence diagram below continues after the sequence diagram above.

.Reservation canceled by the CPO
image::images/command_reservenow_canceled_by_cpo.svg[Reservation canceled by the CPO]

_These examples use OCPP 1.6 based commands between CPO and Charge Point, but that is not a requirement for OCPI.

If the Sender (typically eMSP) wants to have a reference between the calls send to the Receivers interface and the asynchronous result received from the Charge Point via the CPO,
the Sender can make some unique identifier part of the`response_url` that is part of every method in the Receiver interface.
The Receiver will call this URL when the result is received from the Charge Point. The Sender can then match the unique identifier from the URL called with the request.

[[mod_commands_interfaces_and_endpoints]]
=== Interfaces and endpoints

The commands module consists of two interfaces: a Receiver interface that enables a Sender (typically eMSP) (and its clients) to send commands to a Location/EVSE
and an Sender interface to receive the response from the Location/EVSE asynchronously.

[[mod_commands_commandresponse_object]]
==== _CommandResponse_ Object

The CommandResponse object is send in the HTTP response body.

Because OCPI does not allow/require retries, it could happen that the asynchronous result url given by the eMSP is never successfully called.
The eMSP might have had a glitch, HTTP 500 returned, was offline for a moment etc.
For the eMSP to be able to give a quick as possible response to another system or driver app. it is important for the eMSP to known the timeout on a certain command.

[[mod_commands_reservenow_object]]
==== _ReserveNow_ Object

The `evse_uid` is optional. If no EVSE is specified, the Charge Point should keep one EVSE available for the EV Driver identified by the given Token. (This might not be supported by all Charge Points).
A reservation can be replaced/updated by sending a `RESERVE_NOW` request with the same Location (Charge Point) and the same `reservation_id`.

A successful reservation will result in a new `Session` object being created by the CPO.

A not used Reservation of a Charge Point/EVSE MAY result in cost being made, thus also a CDR.

The eMSP provides a Token that has to be used by the Charge Point.
The Token provided by the eMSP for the `ReserveNow` SHALL be authorized by the eMSP before sending it to the CPO.
Therefor the CPO SHALL NOT check the validity of the Token provided before sending the request to the Charge Point.

If this is an OCPP Charge Point, the Charge Point decides if it needs to validate the given Token, in such case:

- If this Token is of type: `AD_HOC_USER` or `APP_USER` the CPO SHALL NOT do a <<mod_tokens_real-time_authorization,realtime authorization>> at the eMSP for this .
- If this Token is of type: `RFID`, the CPO SHALL NOT do a <<mod_tokens_real-time_authorization,realtime authorization>>
at the eMSP for this Token at the given EVSE/Charge Point within 15 minutes after having received this `ReserveNow`.

The eMSP MAY use Tokens that have not been pushed via the <<mod_tokens_tokens_module,Token>> module,
especially `AD_HOC_USER` or `APP_USER` Tokens are only used by commands send by an eMSP. As these are never used locally at the Charge Point like `RFID`.

Unknown Tokens received by the CPO in the `ReserveNow` Object don't need to be stored in the <<mod_tokens_tokens_module,Token>> module.
In other words, when a Token has been received via `ReserveNow`, the same `Token` does not have to be returned in a Token GET request from the eMSP.

An eMSP sending a `ReserveNow` SHALL only use Token that are owned by this eMSP in `ReserveNow`, using Tokens of other eMSPs is not allowed.

The `reservation_id` send by the Sender (eMSP) to the Receiver (CPO) SHALL NOT be send directly to a Charge Point.
The CPO SHALL make sure the Reservation ID send to the Charge Point is unique, is not used by another Sender (eMSP).
We don't want a Sender (eMSP) to replace or cancel a reservation of another Sender (eMSP).

[[mod_commands_startsession_object]]
==== _StartSession_ Object

The `evse_uid` is optional. If no EVSE is specified, the Charge Point can itself decide on which EVSE to start a new session. (this might not be supported by all Charge Points).

The eMSP provides a Token that has to be used by the Charge Point.
The Token provided by the eMSP for the `StartSession` SHALL be authorized by the eMSP before sending it to the CPO.
Therefor the CPO SHALL NOT check the validity of the Token provided before sending the request to the Charge Point.

If this is an OCPP Charge Point, the Charge Point decides if it needs to validate the given Token, in such case:

- If this Token is of type: `AD_HOC_USER` or `APP_USER` the CPO SHALL NOT do a <<mod_tokens_real-time_authorization,realtime authorization>>
  at the eMSP for this .
- If this Token is of type: `RFID`, the CPO SHALL NOT do a <<mod_tokens_real-time_authorization,realtime authorization>>
  at the eMSP for this Token at the given EVSE/Charge Point within 15 minutes after having received this `StartSession`.
(This means that if the driver decided to use his RFID within 15 minutes at the same Charge Point, because the app is not working somehow, the RFID is already authorized)

The eMSP MAY use Tokens that have not been pushed via the <<mod_tokens_tokens_module,Token>> module,
especially `AD_HOC_USER` or `APP_USER` Tokens are only used by commands send by an eMSP. As these are never used locally at the Charge Point like `RFID`.

Unknown Tokens received by the CPO in the `StartSession` Object don't need to be stored in the <<mod_tokens_tokens_module,Token>> module.
In other words, when a Token has been received via `StartSession`, the same `Token` does not have to be returned in a Token GET request from the eMSP.
However, the information of the Token SHALL be put in the `Session` and `CDR`.

An eMSP sending a `StartSession` SHALL only use Token that are owned by this eMSP in `StartSession`, using Tokens of other eMSPs is not allowed.

NOTE: In case of an OCPP 1.x Charge Point, the EVSE ID should be mapped to the connector ID of a Charge Point.
OCPP 1.x does not have good support for Charge Points that have multiple connectors per EVSE.
To make StartSession over OCPI work, the CPO SHOULD present the different connectors of an EVSE as separate EVSE,
as is also written by the OCA in the application note: "Multiple Connectors per EVSE in a OCPP 1.x implementation".

*The command `UNLOCK_CONNECTOR` may only be used by an operator or the eMSP. This command SHALL never be allowed to be sent directly by the EV-Driver.
The `UNLOCK_CONNECTOR` is intended to be used in the rare situation that the connector is not unlocked successfully after a transaction is stopped. The mechanical unlock of the lock mechanism might get stuck, for example: fail when there is tension on the charging cable when the Charge Point tries to unlock the connector.
In such a situation the EV-Driver can call either the CPO or the eMSP to retry the unlocking.*

[[mod_charging_profiles_module]]
== _ChargingProfiles_ module

*Module Identifier: `chargingprofiles`*

*Type:* Functional Module

With the ChargingProfiles module, parties (SCSP but also MSPs) can send (Smart) Charging Profiles to a Location/EVSE.
It is also possible to request the 'ActiveChargingProfile' from a Location/EVSE.

The ActiveChargingProfile is the charging profile as calculated by the EVSE.
It is the result of the calculation of all smart charging inputs present in the EVSE, also Local Limits might be taken into account.

The ChargingProfile is similar to the concept of Charging Profiles in OCPP,
but exposes this functionality to third parties.
These objects and the accompanying interfaces make certain abstractions that make them more suitable for energy parties to signal their intent.
The data structures are base on OCPP 1.6 and 2.0 to make conversion of messages between OCPI and OCPP easy.

NOTE: Charging Profiles set via this module are no guarantee that the EV will charge with the exact given limit,
it is a maximum limit, not a target.
A lot of factors influence the charging speed. The EV might not take the amount of energy that the EVSE is willing to provide to it,
the battery might be too warm or almost full. A single phase cable might be used on a three phase Charge Point.
There can be local energy limits (load balancing between EVSEs on a relative small energy connection to a group of EVSEs)
that might limit the energy offered by the EVSE to the EV even further.

ChargingProfile can be created by the owner of a Token on Sessions that belong to that token.
If another party sends a ChargingProfile and the CPO has no contract that allows that party to set profiles on sessions,
the CPO is allowed to reject such profiles.

This module can be used by the eMSP, but can also be used by another party that provide "Smart Charging Services" (Smart Charging Service Provider (SCSP) / Aggregator / Energy Service Broker etc.)
These SCSPs then depend on the CPO sending session information to them. They need to know which session is ongoing to be able to influence it.
If a SCSP uses this module, read eMSP as SCSP.

NOTE: OCPI provides the means for SCSPs to do this.
Parties doing this have to adhere to local privacy laws, have to have setup contracts etc.
Local laws might oblige explicit consent from the driver etc.

*Module dependency:* <<mod_sessions_sessions_module,Sessions module>>


[[mod_charging_profiles_toplogies]]
=== Smart Charging Topologies

There are different Smart Charging Topologies possible. Which topology can be used depends on the contracts between different parties.

NOTE: Care has to be taken to prevent mixing the different topologies.
When multiple parties start sending Charging Profiles, the resulting charging speed might be unpredictable.
In case of OCPP Charge Points, the result will be the minimum of all the Charging Profiles, resulting in a slower than needed charging speed.


[[mod_charging_profiles_toplogies_emsp]]
==== The eMSP generates ChargingProfiles.

The most straight forward topology, the eMSP generates ChargingProfiles for its own customers, no SCSP is involved.
The eMSP 'owns' the customer, so if the eMSP knows that its customer agrees with the eMSP manipulating the charging speed, the eMSP is free to do this.

[[mod_charging_profiles_toplogies_emsp_scspp]]
==== The eMSP delegated Smart Charging to SCSP.

In the topology, the eMSP has delegated the generation of ChargingProfiles to a SCSP.
For this, the eMSP and SCSP have agreed to use OCPI as the interface.

The eMSP 'owns' the customer, so if the eMSP knows that its customer agrees with the eMSP manipulating the charging speed, the eMSP is free to do this.
The eMSP can forward OCPI <<mod_sessions_session_object,Session>> Objects to the SCSP.
the SCSP can act on the received/updated <<mod_sessions_session_object,Session>> Objects, by sending Charging Profile commands via the eMSP to the CPO.

The eMSP and SCSP have to take into account that they have to oblige to local privacy laws when exchanging information about eMSPs customers.

From the CPO point of view, this topology is similar to the one above, the CPO will not know the difference.

[[mod_charging_profiles_toplogies_cpo_scspp]]
==== The CPO delegated Smart Charging to SCSP.

In this topology, the CPO has delegated the generation of ChargingProfiles to a SCSP.
For this, the CPO and SCSP have agreed to use OCPI as the interface.

The CPO 'owns' the EVSE on which charging happens.
As the CPO does not 'own' the customers, the CPO needs to make sure the EV driver knows that the charging speed might not
be the maximum the driver has expected, this could be something as simple as a sticker on the Charge Point,
or might even be part of the tariff text.

The CPO might generate ChargingProfiles themselves, but as OCPI is then not used this is not part of this document.

The CPO can forward OCPI <<mod_sessions_session_object,Session>> Objects to the SCSP.
the SCSP can act on the received/updated <<mod_sessions_session_object,Session>> Objects, by sending Charging Profile commands to the CPO.

The CPO and SCSP have to take into account that they have to oblige to local privacy laws when exchanging information about eMSPs customers.

In this topology, the eMSP is not aware that the CPO is using OCPI to receive Charging Profiles from the SCSP.

[[mod_charging_profiles_use_cases]]
=== Use Cases

This module is designed to support the following use cases, for all the above mentioned topologies.

- The eMSP/SCSP sends/updates a ChargingProfile to manipulate an ongoing charging session.
- The eMSP/SCSP request to remove the set ChargingProfile from an ongoing charging session.
- The eMSP/SCSP request the ActiveChargingProfile for an ongoing charging session.
- The CPO updates the eMSP/SCSP of changes to an ActiveChargingProfile.


[[mod_charging_profiles_flow]]
=== Flow

The ChargingProfile creation is a request to activate a charging profile on a running charging session.

Most Charge Points are hooked up to the internet via a relative slow wireless connection. To prevent long blocking calls,
the ChargingProfile module is designed to work asynchronously. (similar to the <<mod_commands_commands_module,`Commands`>> module.

The Sender (Typically SCSP) sends a request to a Receiver (Typically CPO), via the Receiver interface.
The Receiver checks if it can send the request to a Charge Point and will respond to the request with a status, indicating if the request can be sent to a Charge Point.

The Receiver sends the requested command (via another protocol, for example: OCPP) to a Charge Point.
The Charge Point will respond if it understands the command and will try to execute the command.
This response doesn't always mean that the ChargingProfile will be executed.
The CPO will forward the result in a new POST request to the Sender (Typically SCSP) ChargingProfile interface.

The Sender (Typically SCSP) can send the Charging Profile to the EVSE via the CPO by using the <<mod_charging_profiles_cpo_put_method,CPO PUT method>> for an ongoing session.
The Sender can request the current profile the EVSE has calculated, based on different inputs, and is planned to be used for the ongoing session by calling the <<mod_charging_profiles_cpo_get_method,CPO GET method>>.
The Sender has the ability to remove the Charging Profile for the session by calling the <<mod_charging_profiles_cpo_delete_method,CPO DELETE method>>

When the Sender has (at least once) successfully sent a Charging Profile for an ongoing charging session,
the Receiver (Typically CPO) SHALL keep the Sender updated with changes to the ActiveChargingProfile of that Session.
If the Receiver is aware of any changes, he notifies the Sender by calling the <<mod_charging_profiles_msp_put_method,MSP PUT method>>.
The changes might be triggered by the CPO sending additional Charging Profiles, or the some local limit being applied to the Charge Point,
and the Charge Point notifies the CPO of the Changes.

The Receiver can cancel/remove an existing ChargingProfile, it can let the eMSP know by calling the <<mod_charging_profiles_msp_put_method,MSP PUT method>>

For calculating optimum ChargingProfiles it might be useful for the eMSP or SCSP to know the ChargingProfile that the Charge Point has planned for the Session: ActiveChargingProfile.
The ActiveChargingProfile might differ from ChargingProfile requested via OCPI. There might be other limiting factors being taken into account by the CPO and or Charge Point,
that limit the ChargingProfile.
The ActiveChargingProfile profile can be requested by the Sender by calling the <<mod_charging_profiles_cpo_get_method,CPO GET method>> on the Charging Profile Receiver interface.
The CPO will then ask the Charge Point   for the planned ActiveChargingProfile. When that is received it is forwarded to the URL given by the eMSP or SCSP.

The CPO can limit the amount of request that can be done on the Charging Profiles interface, this too prevent creating a too high load or data usages.
To do this the CPO can reject a request on the Charging Profile Receiver interface be responding with: TOO_OFTEN.

If the Sender  (typically eMSP or SCSP) wants to have a reference between the calls send to the Receivers interface and the asynchronous result received from the Charge Point via the CPO,
the Sender can make some unique identifier part of the`response_url` that is part of every method in the Receiver interface.
The Receiver will call this URL when the result is received from the Charge Point. The Sender can then match the unique identifier from the URL called with the request.


==== Example of setting/updating a ChargingProfile by the Sender (typically the SCSP or eMSP)

When a new <<mod_sessions_session_object,Session>> is started,
or when an update to an existing <<mod_sessions_session_object,Session>> is available,
the CPO sends the Session object to the eMSP or SCSP.
The eMSP or SCSP calculates a Charging Profile and sends it to the CPO by calling the Charging Profiles <<mod_charging_profiles_cpo_put_method,PUT>> method on the Receiver interface.

The CPO responds to the eMSP or SCSP, the response body will contain the response to the request,
acknowledging the request was understood and can be forwarded to the Charge Point.

The CPO sends the requests to the Charge Point.
When the CPO receives a response from the Charge Point,
that result is sent to the eMSP or SCSP by call the <<mod_charging_profiles_msp_post_method,POST>> method,
on the URL provided by the eMSP of SCSP in the <<mod_charging_profiles_cpo_put_method,PUT>> request,
this call will contain a <<mod_charging_profiles_charging_profiles_result_object,ChargingProfileResult>> Object.

.Example of a SetChargingProfile.
image::images/sd_charging_profile_set.svg[Example of a SetChargingProfile]


==== Example of a setting/updating a ChargingProfile by the SCSP via the eMSP

When a new Session is started, the CPO sends the Session object to the eMSP, the eMSP forwards the Session object to the SCSP.

When a new <<mod_sessions_session_object,Session>> is started,
or when an update to an existing <<mod_sessions_session_object,Session>> is available,
the CPO sends the Session object to the eMSP.
The eMSP forwards the <<mod_sessions_session_object,Session>> Object to the SCSP.
The SCSP calculates a Charging Profile and sends it to the eMSP by calling the Charging Profiles <<mod_charging_profiles_cpo_put_method,PUT>> method on the Sender interface implemented by the eMSP.
The eMSP forwards it to the CPO by calling the Charging Profiles <<mod_charging_profiles_cpo_put_method,PUT>> method on the Receiver interface.

The CPO responds to the eMSP, the response body will contain the response to the request,
acknowledging the request was understood and can be forwarded to the Charge Point.
The eMSP forwards this response to the SCSP.

The CPO sends the requests to the Charge Point.
When the CPO receives a response from the Charge Point,
that result is send to the eMSP by call the <<mod_charging_profiles_msp_post_method,POST>> method,
on the URL provided by the eMSP in the <<mod_charging_profiles_cpo_put_method,PUT>> request of the eMSP.
The eMSP forwards this result to the the URL provided by the SCSP in the <<mod_charging_profiles_cpo_put_method,PUT>> request of the SCSP,
this call will contain a <<mod_charging_profiles_charging_profiles_result_object,ChargingProfileResult>> Object.

for example the EV driver has selected to switch to charging with the highest speed possible.
The Sender can ask the CPO to remove the set charging profile by calling.
This can be done by calling the <<mod_charging_profiles_cpo_delete_method,DELETE>> method on the Receiver interface.

The CPO responds to the eMSP, the response body will contain the response to the request,
acknowledging the request was accepted and can be forwarded to the Charge Point.
The eMSP forwards this response to the SCSP.

The CPO sends a message to the Charge Point to retrieve the current active charging profile.
When the CPO receives a response from the Charge Point,
that ActiveChargingProfile is send to the eMSP by call the <<mod_charging_profiles_msp_post_method,POST>> method,
on the URL provided by the eMSP in the <<mod_charging_profiles_cpo_put_method,PUT>> request of the eMSP,
this call will contain a <<mod_charging_profiles_active_charging_profiles_result_object,ActiveChargingProfileResult>> Object.
The eMSP forwards this result to the the URL provided by the SCSP in the <<mod_charging_profiles_cpo_put_method,PUT>> request of the SCSP,
this call will contain a <<mod_charging_profiles_active_charging_profiles_result_object,ActiveChargingProfileResult>> Object.

====  Example of the Receiver (typically the CPO) sending an updated ActiveChargingProfile

When the CPO knows the ActiveChargingProfile of a Charge Point has changed,
the Receiver (typically the CPO) sends this update <<mod_charging_profiles_active_charging_profile_class,ActiveChargingProfile>> to the Sender (typically the eMSP or SCSP),
by calling the <<mod_charging_profiles_msp_put_method,PUT>> method on the Sender interface.

[[mod_charging_profiles_interfaces_and_endpoints]]
=== Interfaces and endpoints

The ChargingProfiles module consists of two interfaces: a Receiver interface that enables a Sender (and its clients) to send ChargingProfiles to a Location/EVSE,
and an Sender interface to receive the response from the Location/EVSE asynchronously.

[[mod_charging_profiles_cpo_interface]]

|===


[[mod_charging_profiles_msp_post_method]]
===== *POST* Method

[[mod_charging_profiles_cpo_post_request_parameters]]
====== Request Parameters

There are no URL segment parameters required by OCPI.

As the Sender interface is called by the Receiver (typically CPO) on the URL given `response_url` in the Sender request to the Receiver interface.
It is up to the implementation of the Sender (typically SCSP) to determine what parameters are put in the URL.
The Sender sends a URL in the POST method body to the Receiver.
The Receiver is required to use this URL for the asynchronous response by the Charge Point.
It is advised to make this URL unique for every request to differentiate simultaneous commands,
for example by adding a unique id as a URL segment.

Endpoint structure definition:

No structure defined. This is open to the eMSP to define, the URL is provided to the Receiver by the Sender.
Therefor OCPI does not define variables.

Examples:

`+https://www.server.com/ocpi/2.2/chargingprofiles/chargingprofile/12345678+`

`+https://www.server.com/activechargingprofile/12345678+`

`+https://www.server.com/clearprofile?request_id=12345678+`

`+https://www.server.com/ocpi/2.2/12345678+`

The content of the request body depends on the original request by the eMSP to which this POST is send as a result.

|===

===== Response Body

The response to the POST on the Sender interface SHALL contain the <<transport_and_format_response_format,Response Format>> with the data field omitted.


[[mod_charging_profiles_msp_put_method]]
===== *PUT* Method

Updates the Sender (typically SCSP) when the Receiver (typically CPO) knows the ActiveChargingProfile has changed.

The Receiver SHALL call this interface every time it knows changes have been made that influence the ActiveChargingProfile for an ongoing session AND
the Sender has at least once successfully called the charging profile Receiver PUT interface for this session (SetChargingProfile).
If the Receiver doesn't know the ActiveChargingProfile has changed (EVSE does not notify the Receiver (typically CPO) of the change) it is not required to call this interface.

The Receiver SHALL NOT call this interface for any session where the Sender has never, successfully called the charging profile Receiver PUT interface for this session (SetChargingProfile).

The Receiver SHALL send a useful relevant duration of ActiveChargingProfile to send to the Sender. As a guide: between 5 and 60 minutes.
If the Sender wants a longer ActiveChargingProfile the Sender can always do a GET with a longer duration.

[[mod_hub_client_info_module]]
== _HubClientInfo_ module

*Module Identifier: `hubclientinfo`*

*Data owner: `Hub`*

*Type:* Configuration Module

This module provides parties connected to a hub with the connection status of other parties that are connected to a hub that they can communicate with.
So, CPOs know which eMSP and other parties are online and vice versa.

Unlike the usual OCPI modules, this module is between eMSP/CPO and Hub instead of between eMSP and CPO.

=== Scenarios

This section will describe what the expected behavior is when a party receives information of a ConnectionState change.

==== Another Party becomes CONNECTED

Party is (back) online. Request can be sent again.
Every party receiving Client Owned Objects from this party should be prepared to receive Client Owned Objects with URLs
that contain the party_id and country_code of this party.

==== Another Party goes OFFLINE

Connection to party is not available: No requests can be sent.
Do not queue Push messages. When the other party comes back online, it is their responsibility to do a GET to get back in sync.

==== Another Party becomes PLANNED

No requests can be sent to this new party yet.
It can be a good idea to sent some notification to an operator to get into contact with the new party so contracts can be setup.
This state may also be used when a Hub has some configuration indicating which parties have contracts which each other.
When a company does not have a connection configured.
This state may also be sent to parties.

==== Another Party becomes SUSPENDED

Like with OFFLINE, no requests should be sent to this party, they cannot be delivered.

When for example CDRs still have to be delivered, so there is some unfinished business,
parties are advised to get into contact with the other party in another way the OCPI: Call them, send an e-mail.


[[mod_hub_client_info_flow]]
=== Flow and Life-cycle

[[mod_hub_client_info_push_model]]
==== Push model

When the Hub creates a new ClientInfo object they push it to the connected parties by calling <<mod_hub_client_info_client_put,PUT>> 
on the connected party ClientInfo endpoint with the newly created ClientInfo object.

Any changes to ClientInfo in the Hub system are send to the connected party system by calling the <<mod_hub_client_info_client_put,PUT>>
method on the connected party ClientInfo endpoint with the updated ClientInfo.

When the Hub invalidates a ClientInfo object (deleting is not possible), the Hub will send the updated ClientInfo object 
(with the field: status set to SUSPENDED, by calling the <<mod_hub_client_info_client_put,PUT>> method
on the connected party ClientInfo endpoint with the updated ClientInfo object.

When the connected party is not sure about the state or existence of a ClientInfo object in the Hub system, the
connected party can call the <<mod_hub_client_info_hub_get,GET>> to request to ClientInfo object from the Hub system.


[[mod_hub_client_info_pull_model]]
==== Pull model

When a connected party is not sure about the state of the list of known connected parties of a Hub, or wants to request the full
list at the start-up of their system, the connected party can call the <<mod_hub_client_info_hub_get,GET>> on the Hubs ClientInfo endpoint to receive
all ClientInfo objects.
This method is not for operational flow.


==== Still alive check.

The hubs needs to determine if a connection is still "alive".

To do this, the Hub should keep track of the time that has passed since the last message was received from a connected party.
When this is longer then X minutes (when unsure, start with 5 minutes) the Hub should send a: GET to the Version information endpoint.
As the Version information endpoint is always required in OCPI,
and this endpoint is provided by all parties,
and a GET to the versions endpoint does not have any side effects, this is seen as the best way to do an "still-alive"check.


=== Interfaces

There is both a Sender (Typically Hub) as a Receiver interface for ClientInfo.
It is advised to use the Push direction from Sender to connected clients during normal operation.
The Hub interface is meant to be used when the connected client is not 100% sure the ClientInfo cache is still correct.

[[mod_hub_client_info_client_interface]]
==== Receiver Interface

Typically implemented by all parties connecting to a Hub.

With this interface the Hub can push the ClientInfo information to a connected client (eMSP/CPO etc)
Example endpoint structure:
`/ocpi/cpo/2.0/clientinfo/{country_code}/{party_id}`

[cols="2,12",options="header"]
|===
|Method |Description

|<<mod_hub_client_info_client_get,GET>> |Retrieve a ClientInfo object as it is stored in the connected clients system.
|POST |n/a
|<<mod_hub_client_info_client_put,PUT>> |Push new/updated ClientInfo object to the connect client.
|PATCH |n/a
|DELETE |n/a, Use <<mod_hub_client_info_client_put,PUT>>, ClientInfo objects cannot be removed).
|===

[[mod_hub_client_info_client_get]]
===== *GET* Method

If the Hub wants to check the status of a ClientInfo object in the connected clients system it might
GET the object from the connected clients system for validation purposes. The Hub is the owner of the objects,
so it would be illogical if the connected client system had a different status or was missing an object.

Lots of typos fixed and textual improvements.

The following changes to messages/objects etc.

[cols="6,2,2,12",options="header"]

|Context (Module / Object)
|Expected Impact: +
eMSP / CPO
|Expected Effort: +
eMSP / CPO
|Description

|CDRs / +
CDR Object
|Medium / +
Major
|Average / +
Large
|- Added `county_code` and `party_id` fields, making it easier to determine the owner of a CDR. +
- Added `session_id` field, making it easier to match a CDR to a Session. +
- Renamed `stop_date_time` field to `end_date_time`, to bring the naming inline with the rest of OCPI. +
- Changed `total_cost` field from type: `number` to `Price`, this provides the eMSP with the total cost including VAT. +
- Replaced `auth_id` field with `CdrToken`. `auth_id` alone could not be used to uniquely identify a <<mod_tokens_token_object,Token>>. By copying the information for the dynamic Token object, the CDR will always reflect the 'true' status of Token at the start of the charging session. +
- Replaced `location` field with `cdr_location`, this also changed type, from `Location` to `CdrLocation`. Reusing the `Location` object always caused a lot of confusing, things were not clear. By creating a deticated object `CdrLocation` with only the relevant fields, things should be much clearer. +
- Added `credit` and `credit_reference_id` fields, to allow for Credit CDRs to be send. +
- Added `total_fixed_cost`, `total_energy_cost`, `total_time_cost`, `total_parking_cost` and `total_reservation_cost` fields, to allow more cost details in the CDRs. +
- Added `authorization_reference` field for binding an authorization to the resulting session. +
- Added `signed_data` field, enabling OCPI to be used to transport signed meter data from the Charge Point to the eMSP and EV driver, can be used for Eichrecht. +
- Added `invoice_reference_id` field (optional), to allow a CDRs to reference an invoice. +
- Field `id` changed in length from 36 to 39, to allow for something to be appended after the original id in case of a Credit CDR.
